The flaw, rated 9.3 on the CVSS scale, allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by sending a malicious request to the 'dnscfg.cgi' endpoint. Exploitation has been observed since at least November 2025, with attackers using it for 'DNSChanger' style attacks. D-Link has confirmed the vulnerability but stated that since the affected products are discontinued, no security patches will be issued. Owners are strongly advised to immediately retire and replace the vulnerable devices to prevent compromise.","## Executive Summary\nA critical zero-day command injection vulnerability, **[CVE-2026-0625](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-0625)**, is being actively exploited in multiple discontinued **[D-Link](https://www.dlink.com/)** DSL routers. The flaw carries a CVSS score of 9.3 and allows for unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE). Threat actors are leveraging this vulnerability to execute arbitrary shell commands on affected devices. D-Link has confirmed the issue but has stated that no patches will be released because the impacted models have reached their end-of-life (EOL). Security researchers and D-Link are urging all users of the affected routers to immediately decommission and replace them to prevent their networks from being compromised.\n\n## Vulnerability Details\nThe vulnerability is an OS command injection flaw located in the `dnscfg.cgi` Common Gateway Interface (CGI) script. This script is part of the router's web-based management interface and is responsible for processing DNS configuration changes. The script fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before passing it to a system command. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can craft a malicious HTTP request to this endpoint, injecting arbitrary shell commands that will be executed on the router's underlying operating system with root privileges.\n\n### Affected Systems\nWhile D-Link is still conducting a full firmware review, the following models are known or suspected to be vulnerable:\n*   DSL-2740R\n*   DSL-2640B\n*   DSL-2780B\n*   DSL-526B\n*   Other discontinued DSL gateway models.\n\n## Exploitation Status\nThis is a zero-day vulnerability with confirmed active exploitation in the wild. The **[Shadowserver Foundation](https://www.shadowserver.org/)** has observed exploitation attempts dating back to at least late November 2025. The attacks are consistent with \"DNSChanger\" campaigns, where attackers modify the router's DNS settings to redirect user traffic to malicious sites for phishing, ad-fraud, or malware delivery. The vulnerability was reported to D-Link on December 16, 2025, by researchers at **VulnCheck** who had also observed live exploitation.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThe exploit is straightforward for an attacker to execute. They simply need to send a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint. For example:\n\n```http\nGET /dnscfg.cgi?service_name=wan&ifname=br0&dns_server_ip=8.8.8.8;`[malicious_command]`\n```\n\nThe router's firmware concatenates the `dns_server_ip` parameter into a shell command without validation, allowing the backticks and the enclosed command to be executed by the system. Compromised routers can be absorbed into botnets for DDoS attacks, used as proxies for further malicious activity, or leveraged to intercept and manipulate the owner's internet traffic.\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK Mapping\n*   [`T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/): The attack targets a vulnerability in the router's web management interface.\n*   [`T1203 - Exploitation for Client Execution`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203/): The vulnerability leads to code execution on the edge device.\n*   [`T1059.004 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004/): The payload is executed via command injection into the device's shell.\n*   [`T1565.003 - Data Manipulation: Stored Data Manipulation`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/003/): Attackers modify the DNS settings on the router, a form of stored data manipulation.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe impact of this vulnerability is high for any individual or small business still using these EOL devices. A successful exploit grants an attacker full control over the router, which is the gateway to the local network. Potential consequences include:\n*   **Traffic Interception**: Attackers can perform man-in-the-middle attacks, stealing credentials, session cookies, and other sensitive data.\n*   **Phishing and Malware Delivery**: By controlling DNS, attackers can redirect users to fake websites for credential harvesting or to sites that deliver malware.\n*   **Botnet Enlistment**: The compromised router can be used as part of a larger botnet to conduct DDoS attacks or send spam.\n*   **Internal Network Pivoting**: An attacker could use the compromised router to scan and attack other devices on the local network.\n\nSince no patch will be provided, these devices will remain perpetually vulnerable.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `url_pattern` | `/dnscfg.cgi` | Monitor for any access attempts to this CGI script, especially from external IP addresses. |\n| `network_traffic_pattern` | `dns_server_ip=` | Look for suspicious shell commands embedded within the `dns_server_ip` parameter in GET requests. |\n| `dns_query` | `*` | Monitor for outbound DNS queries to unexpected or known malicious DNS servers from the router itself. |\n\n## Mitigation\n**There is no patch for this vulnerability.** The only effective mitigation is to **immediately disconnect, retire, and replace** any affected D-Link router.\n\n1.  **Identify Affected Devices**: All organizations and individuals should audit their network hardware to identify if any of the vulnerable D-Link models are in use.\n2.  **Decommission**: Immediately disconnect any identified vulnerable router from the internet.\n3.  **Replace**: Replace the EOL device with a modern, supported router from a reputable vendor that provides regular security updates.\n4.  **Network Segmentation**: As a general best practice, do not expose the management interface of any router or network device to the public internet. Access should be restricted to the internal LAN only. This is a core principle of D3FEND's [`D3-NI - Network Isolation`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkIsolation).","⚠️ URGENT: A zero-day RCE (CVE-2026-0625) is actively exploited in end-of-life D-Link routers.
