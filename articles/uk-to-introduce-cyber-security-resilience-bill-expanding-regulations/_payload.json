The bill will replace the 2018 NIS Regulations, expanding their scope to include Managed Service Providers (MSPs), data centers, and cloud platforms. It will impose stricter assessment, supply chain accountability, and a 24-hour incident reporting requirement.","## Executive Summary\nThe **[United Kingdom](https://www.gov.uk/)** government is set to introduce the Cyber Security & Resilience Bill (CSRB) in 2025, a landmark piece of legislation designed to significantly strengthen the nation's cybersecurity posture. The CSRB will replace the existing Network and Information Systems (NIS) Regulations from 2018 and substantially broaden their scope. A key change is the inclusion of Managed Service Providers (MSPs), data centers, and cloud platforms as regulated entities, reflecting the critical role they play in the digital supply chain. The bill will introduce more stringent requirements for cybersecurity risk management, supply chain security, and incident reporting, backed by increased financial penalties for non-compliance.\n\n---\n\n## Regulatory Details\nThe Cyber Security & Resilience Bill is a core component of the UK's National Cyber Strategy. Its primary goal is to enhance the resilience of the UK's critical infrastructure and the wider digital economy against cyber threats. It aims to achieve this by modernizing and expanding the legal framework established by the NIS Regulations.\n\nKey provisions of the new bill include:\n*   **Expanded Scope:** The regulations will no longer be limited to traditional 'Operators of Essential Services' (e.g., energy, transport, healthcare). The CSRB will extend to cover critical digital service providers, including MSPs, data centers, and cloud platforms.\n*   **Supply Chain Accountability:** For the first time, there will be direct legal accountability for managing cyber risk within the supply chain. Organizations will be required to demonstrate they have proactive security controls and risk management processes for their entire digital ecosystem.\n*   **Stricter Incident Reporting:** The bill will implement a new two-stage incident reporting framework. An initial report must be made to the relevant regulator and the **[National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/)** within 24 hours of identifying a significant cyber incident, with a more detailed report to follow.\n\n---\n\n## Affected Organizations\nThe CSRB will have a wide-ranging impact on UK businesses. The list of regulated entities will expand significantly to include:\n*   Operators of Essential Services (as defined under the original NIS Regulations).\n*   Managed Service Providers (MSPs).\n*   Cloud Service Providers.\n*   Data Center Operators.\n*   Other critical digital suppliers and service providers.\n\nThis means that thousands of new organizations, particularly within the IT and technology sectors, will fall under this regulatory regime for the first time.\n\n---\n\n## Compliance Requirements\nOrganizations covered by the CSRB will face a higher bar for compliance. They will be expected to:\n*   Conduct more frequent and comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessments.\n*   Provide tangible evidence of their security posture and controls to regulators.\n*   Implement and document a robust third-party risk management program to oversee supply chain security.\n*   Develop and test an incident response plan that accommodates the new 24-hour reporting deadline.\n*   Appoint senior individuals with clear responsibility for cybersecurity resilience.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Timeline\nThe Cyber Security & Resilience Bill is expected to be introduced in the UK Parliament during the 2025 legislative session. Following its passage, there will likely be a transition period for businesses to adapt to the new requirements before enforcement begins.\n\n---\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe CSRB will necessitate a significant investment in cybersecurity for many UK businesses. Organizations, especially MSPs and other newly-regulated entities, will need to allocate resources to enhance their security controls, risk management processes, and compliance teams. The focus on supply chain security will require companies to conduct more rigorous due diligence on their vendors and partners, potentially increasing procurement costs and complexity. The short 24-hour incident reporting window will demand highly efficient and well-practiced incident response capabilities. While this represents an increased compliance burden, the intended outcome is a more resilient and secure digital economy for the UK.\n\n---\n\n## Enforcement & Penalties\nWhile specific figures have not been finalized, the UK government has indicated that the CSRB will introduce greater financial penalties for non-compliance than those under the current NIS Regulations. This is intended to ensure that cybersecurity is treated as a top-level business priority.\n\n---\n\n## Compliance Guidance\nOrganizations that anticipate falling under the scope of the CSRB should begin preparing now:\n1.  **Conduct a Gap Analysis:** Assess your current security posture against the known principles of the NIS Regulations and the expected requirements of the CSRB.\n2.  **Review Your Supply Chain:** Start identifying your critical suppliers and evaluating their security practices. Begin incorporating stronger cybersecurity clauses into vendor contracts.\n3.  **Update Incident Response Plans:** Revise your IR plan to meet the 24-hour initial reporting requirement. This includes clearly defining what constitutes a 'significant' incident and establishing clear lines of communication with legal counsel, leadership, and regulators.\n4.  **Invest in Governance:** Ensure there is clear board-level ownership of cyber risk and that your governance structure can support the increased demands for evidence and reporting.","🇬🇧 The UK plans a major cybersecurity law overhaul with the Cyber Security & Resilience Bill (CSRB) in 2025.
