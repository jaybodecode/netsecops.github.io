The breach exposed the personal information, including names and Social Security numbers, of approximately 147,321 individuals, primarily current and former employees. Under the settlement, affected individuals can file claims for reimbursement of expenses and time spent dealing with the breach's aftermath, with a claim deadline of November 11, 2025.","## Executive Summary\n**[Panera Bread](https://www.panerabread.com/en-us/home.html)** has agreed to a $2.5 million settlement to resolve a class-action lawsuit stemming from a data breach on March 23, 2024. The breach compromised the personally identifiable information (PII), including names and Social Security numbers, of approximately 147,321 individuals. The affected population consists mainly of current and former employees, along with a small number of customers and contractors. The settlement, which received preliminary approval in July 2025, allows affected individuals to claim reimbursement for financial losses and time spent mitigating the effects of the breach, though **Panera Bread** does not admit any wrongdoing.\n\n---\n\n## Regulatory Details\nThe case is a class-action lawsuit filed against **Panera Bread** alleging that the company failed to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures to protect sensitive personal information, leading to the breach. The settlement provides a framework for compensating victims for damages incurred as a result of the data exposure.\n\n**Settlement Terms:**\n- **Total Fund:** $2.5 million\n- **Eligible Class Members:** Individuals who received a data breach notification from **Panera Bread** regarding the March 2024 incident.\n- **Ordinary Expense Reimbursement:** Class members can claim up to $500 for documented out-of-pocket expenses, such as credit monitoring fees, communication costs, and bank fees.\n- **Extraordinary Loss Reimbursement:** Individuals who experienced documented identity theft or fraud can claim up to $6,500 for actual losses.\n- **Lost Time Compensation:** Claims can include compensation for up to 10 hours of time spent resolving breach-related issues, at a rate of $25 per hour.\n- **California Statutory Payment:** California residents are eligible for an additional $100 payment.\n\n---\n\n## Affected Organizations\n- **Primary Organization:** **Panera Bread**\n- **Affected Population:** Approximately 147,321 current and former employees, customers, and contractors.\n\n---\n\n## Compliance Requirements\nThe lawsuit and subsequent settlement underscore the legal and financial obligations organizations have under various state data breach notification laws and data privacy regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). These laws require companies to implement reasonable security measures to protect PII and to notify affected individuals in a timely manner following a breach. Failure to do so can result in significant legal liability, regulatory fines, and class-action lawsuits.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Timeline\n- **Data Breach Date:** March 23, 2024\n- **Preliminary Settlement Approval:** July 14, 2025\n- **Claim Filing Deadline:** November 11, 2025\n\n---\n\n## Impact Assessment\nFor **Panera Bread**, the direct financial impact includes the $2.5 million settlement fund plus legal fees, which can be substantial. The company also faces reputational damage, which can affect customer trust and employee morale. For the 147,321 individuals affected, the primary impact is the increased risk of identity theft and fraud due to the exposure of their Social Security numbers. They must now invest time and potentially money in monitoring their credit and protecting their identities, which is what the settlement aims to compensate.\n\n---\n\n## Enforcement & Penalties\nThe primary penalty in this case is the $2.5 million class-action settlement. This amount is intended to cover the costs incurred by the victims and serve as a financial consequence for the alleged security failures. Regulatory bodies could potentially levy additional fines, but the class-action settlement is the most visible enforcement action in this instance.\n\n---\n\n## Compliance Guidance\nThis incident serves as a reminder for all organizations that handle PII, especially sensitive data like Social Security numbers.\n1.  **Data Governance:** Organizations must know what data they collect, where it is stored, and who has access to it. Implement data minimization principles to avoid collecting or retaining unnecessary PII.\n2.  **Access Controls:** Enforce strict access controls and the principle of least privilege to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data.\n3.  **Data Protection:** Sensitive data like SSNs should be encrypted both at rest and in transit. Robust endpoint security and network monitoring should be in place to detect and prevent unauthorized access.\n4.  **Incident Response:** Have a well-documented and practiced incident response plan to ensure a swift and effective response to any security breach, including timely notification to affected parties as required by law.","Panera Bread agrees to a $2.5M settlement for a 2024 data breach that exposed SSNs of ~147k employees & customers.

For data like Social Security Numbers stored in employee or customer databases, column-level or transparent data encryption (TDE) should be implemented within the database itself. For sensitive files stored on file servers or in cloud storage, file-level encryption should be applied. This ensures that even if an attacker bypasses network defenses and gains access to the underlying storage, the data itself remains unreadable and useless without the corresponding decryption keys.

HR databases containing employee SSNs should not be accessible from the general corporate network. Access should be restricted to a small number of authorized HR personnel, using specific applications from dedicated workstations. Regular access reviews must be conducted to remove permissions that are no longer required. By tightly controlling who and what can access sensitive data, organizations can drastically reduce the attack surface and limit the potential for an attacker who gains an initial foothold to access and exfiltrate the company's most sensitive information.","M1018",[],[],[93,94,95,19,96,97],"data breach","settlement","class action","PII","Social Security Numbers","2025-10-19T15:00:00.000Z","NewsArticle",{"geographic_scope":101,"companies_affected":102,"countries_affected":103,"industries_affected":105,"people_affected_estimate":107},"national",[19],[104],"United States",[106],"Retail","147,321","2025-10-19",4,{"articles":111,"totalCount":2194,"lastUpdated":2195},[112,135,150,167,181,197,216,234,248,262,275,291,307,324,335,347,361,375,390,407,420,432,444,455,469,483,494,507,522,532,544,560,571,585,594,603,616,629,640,652,662,673,685,700,714,727,743,756,766,777,788,797,808,825,838,851,863,876,887,898,912,923,936,947,961,977,990,1004,1017,1030,1041,1053,1067,1080,1090,1102,1115,1128,1140,1151,1166,1178,1181,1194,1208,1219,1236,1248,1261,1272,1284,1296,1306,1317,1328,1338,1350,1362,1377,1388,1401,1412,1424,1433,1443,1454,1464,1476,1488,1500,1510,1520,1532,1543,1557,1570,1580,1592,1601,1613,1624,1634,1648,1659,1669,1682,1693,1706,1717,1729,1741,1753,1765,1777,1789,1800,1813,1823,1833,1844,1856,1867,1877,1889,1900,1914,1924,1937,1948,1959,1968,1979,1989,1998,2008,2017,2028,2038,2049,2059,2072,2080,2089,2100,2110,2122,2133,2144,2155,2163,2173,2183],{"id":113,"slug":114,"headline":115,"title":116,"severity":117,"article_type":118,"excerpt":119,"tags":120,"categories":128,"createdAt":132,"updatedAt":132,"displayDate":133,"isUpdated":134,"readingTime":109},"45a45376-142a-4cac-be1f-3b0c78691165","xwiki-rce-flaw-cve-2025-24893-added-to-cisa-kev-catalog-amid-active-exploitation","CISA KEV Alert: XWiki RCE Flaw Actively Exploited for Cryptomining","CISA Adds Critical Unauthenticated RCE in XWiki (CVE-2025-24893) to KEV Catalog Amid Active Exploitation","critical","Advisory","The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the XWiki enterprise wiki platform, CVE-2025-24893, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.
