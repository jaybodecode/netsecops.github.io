The incident, which occurred in late August, resulted in the stolen data being published on the darknet. In response, the Swedish Data Protection Authority (IMY) has launched a major investigation under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), targeting both Miljödata and several of its public sector clients, including the City of Gothenburg and Region Västmanland.","## Executive Summary\nThe Swedish IT company **Miljödata** has been hit by a massive data breach, resulting in the exposure of personal information belonging to more than 1.5 million individuals. The attackers, who breached the company in late August, subsequently published the stolen data on the darknet. The scale and nature of the breach have prompted the **[Swedish Data Protection Authority (IMY)](https://www.imy.se/en/)** to launch a large-scale investigation. The probe will scrutinize Miljödata's security practices and assess compliance with the **[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)** by both the IT firm and several of its affected public sector clients. This incident highlights the significant supply chain risk associated with third-party IT service providers and the severe regulatory consequences of failing to protect personal data.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe security incident at Miljödata, an IT service provider for numerous Swedish organizations, has led to a significant data leak. An unknown threat actor gained unauthorized access to the company's systems in late August 2025 and exfiltrated a large volume of data. This data, which IMY believes includes sensitive and private details, was later found published on the darknet, making it accessible to other malicious actors.\n\nThe breach has had a cascading effect, impacting several of Miljödata's clients. As a result, IMY's investigation is not only focused on Miljödata but also on public entities that relied on its services, including the **City of Gothenburg**, **Älmhult Municipality**, and **Region Västmanland**.\n\n## Regulatory Details\nThe core of the response is a regulatory investigation by IMY. The primary legal framework is the GDPR, which mandates strong security controls for processing personal data and imposes heavy fines for non-compliance.\n\n- **Scope of Investigation:** The audit will focus on the technical and organizational security measures Miljödata had in place at the time of the breach. It will also assess whether the affected client organizations conducted proper due diligence and had appropriate data processing agreements in place.\n- **Potential Penalties:** Under GDPR, companies can be fined up to €20 million or 4% of their annual global turnover, whichever is higher, for serious infringements. Given the scale of this breach (1.5 million people), the potential penalties are substantial.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe impact of this breach is multi-faceted:\n\n- **For Individuals:** The 1.5 million people whose data was exposed are now at high risk of identity theft, fraud, and targeted phishing attacks. The presence of 'sensitive' data could lead to blackmail or other personal harm.\n- **For Miljödata:** The company faces severe financial penalties from the GDPR investigation, loss of customer trust, and potential civil lawsuits. Its business viability as a trusted IT provider is at stake.\n- **For Public Sector Clients:** The affected municipalities and regions face their own regulatory scrutiny and reputational damage for failing to ensure the security of their third-party data processor. This could lead to a loss of public trust.\n\n## Detection & Response\nFor organizations suffering a similar breach, the response process is critical:\n\n1.  **Containment:** Immediately work to contain the breach and eject the attacker from the network.\n2.  **Assessment:** Engage digital forensics experts to determine the scope of the breach: what data was taken, which systems were affected, and how the attackers got in.\n3.  **Notification:** Comply with GDPR's 72-hour notification requirement, informing the relevant data protection authority (in this case, IMY). Notify affected individuals without undue delay if the breach poses a high risk to their rights and freedoms.\n4.  **Cooperation:** Fully cooperate with the regulatory investigation, providing all requested information and documentation.\n\n## Compliance Guidance\nThis incident serves as a critical lesson in supply chain risk management and GDPR compliance:\n\n- **Vendor Due Diligence:** Organizations must conduct thorough security assessments of all third-party vendors before entrusting them with personal data.\n- **Data Processing Agreements (DPAs):** Ensure robust DPAs are in place that clearly define the security obligations of the data processor (the vendor).\n- **Security Controls:** Implement and maintain strong internal security controls, including data encryption, access management ([`M1026 - Privileged Account Management`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1026/)), and regular vulnerability scanning.\n- **Incident Response Plan:** Have a well-defined and tested incident response plan that specifically addresses data breaches and outlines the steps for regulatory notification.","Massive data breach at Swedish IT firm Miljödata exposes personal info of 1.5 million people.

IT service providers like Miljödata handling sensitive PII must implement robust file and database encryption. This involves using technologies like Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for SQL databases and full-disk encryption for servers. Critically, the management of encryption keys must be secure, using a dedicated Key Management System (KMS) or Hardware Security Module (HSM). Had the 1.5 million user records been properly encrypted, the exfiltrated data would have been unintelligible and useless to the attackers, transforming a catastrophic data breach into a much less severe security incident.",{"technique_id":100,"technique_name":101,"url":102,"recommendation":103,"mitre_mitigation_id":104},"D3-UDTA","User Data Transfer Analysis","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:UserDataTransferAnalysis","To detect and prevent large-scale data exfiltration as seen in the Miljödata incident, organizations should implement User Data Transfer Analysis.

Tactical implementation requires creating policies that alert on or block anomalous data transfers. For an IT provider, this would mean flagging any large outbound data transfer from a production database server to an unknown external destination. Thresholds should be set (e.g., >1GB of data egress in an hour) to trigger an immediate security alert, allowing incident response teams to investigate and potentially terminate the connection before the entire database is stolen.","M1040",[],[],[13,32,108,109,110,111],"Sweden","IMY","Supply Chain Attack","PII","2025-11-05T15:00:00.000Z",{"geographic_scope":114,"countries_affected":115,"industries_affected":116,"people_affected_estimate":119},"national",[108],[117,118],"Government","Technology","1.5 million",4,{"articles":122,"totalCount":4755,"lastUpdated":4756},[123,144,162,180,198,213,228,243,259,275,292,305,318,330,345,360,372,386,401,418,433,450,463,475,492,505,516,532,544,560,571,581,594,607,620,634,646,659,673,688,704,718,732,744,759,772,784,799,808,819,831,845,855,863,877,889,901,912,923,934,946,962,975,988,1002,1016,1027,1038,1050,1063,1075,1087,1100,1113,1126,1140,1152,1166,1179,1191,1204,1218,1232,1246,1257,1271,1283,1298,1314,1326,1340,1356,1368,1378,1390,1402,1415,1425,1438,1451,1464,1474,1487,1499,1511,1520,1532,1547,1558,1569,1582,1592,1600,1609,1620,1631,1644,1654,1663,1675,1686,1698,1711,1720,1731,1741,1750,1761,1772,1785,1796,1808,1821,1834,1849,1865,1876,1887,1903,1916,1928,1938,1950,1962,1976,1989,2004,2018,2032,2045,2057,2070,2082,2096,2106,2117,2128,2141,2153,2164,2173,2184,2193,2205,2218,2229,2243,2255,2265,2277,2289,2299,2307,2319,2332,2340,2351,2364,2374,2384,2395,2409,2419,2431,2442,2454,2464,2476,2487,2497,2509,2519,2529,2539,2547,2556,2570,2581,2589,2601,2609,2618,2628,2641,2651,2654,2667,2678,2692,2703,2713,2725,2735,2747,2759,2771,2781,2793,2802,2813,2825,2838,2850,2859,2871,2881,2892,2903,2916,2932,2942,2952,2962,2974,2987,2998,3011,3021,3032,3042,3051,3064,3076,3089,3102,3112,3124,3136,3148,3158,3169,3181,3192,3206,3217,3227,3238,3248,3258,3268,3281,3290,3301,3315,3325,3338,3346,3357,3368,3380,3389,3399,3411,3424,3437,3448,3463,3475,3484,3494,3503,3511,3521,3535,3547,3558,3568,3578,3589,3600,3612,3623,3636,3647,3661,3672,3686,3699,3711,3720,3731,3741,3750,3761,3772,3784,3795,3805,3819,3830,3842,3853,3866,3877,3891,3902,3913,3924,3933,3943,3953,3963,3974,3983,3995,4007,4019,4028,4040,4051,4062,4071,4081,4091,4101,4111,4122,4133,4143,4152,4163,4173,4185,4196,4206,4216,4225,4236,4246,4256,4269,4279,4289,4300,4310,4321,4332,4344,4356,4368,4378,4389,4401,4411,4422,4432,4442,4452,4461,4471,4483,4496,4506,4519,4529,4540,4549,4558,4567,4576,4585,4594,4603,4612,4622,4632,4642,4650,4659,4668,4678,4687,4698,4708,4719,4727,4736,4745],{"id":124,"slug":125,"headline":126,"title":127,"severity":16,"article_type":128,"excerpt":129,"tags":130,"categories":137,"createdAt":140,"updatedAt":140,"displayDate":141,"isUpdated":142,"readingTime":143},"e00b2b78-398b-4b3b-b7b5-bc3c78e2bcd3","deadlock-ransomware-deploys-byovd-tactic-to-disable-edr","DeadLock Ransomware Uses Vulnerable Baidu Driver to Blind EDRs","DeadLock Ransomware Deploys New \"Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver\" Tactic to Disable Security Tools","NewsArticle","A new DeadLock ransomware campaign is leveraging a novel \"Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver\" (BYOVD) loader to exploit a vulnerability (CVE-2024-51324) in a legitimate Baidu Antivirus driver, `BdApiUtil.sys`.
