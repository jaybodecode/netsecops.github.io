The hacker alleges the theft of 2.15 terabytes of data, impacting up to 4.8 million users. The compromised information reportedly includes a vast trove of personally identifiable information (PII) and highly sensitive protected health information (PHI), such as patient diagnoses and treatment records from nearly 700 healthcare facilities. A 2GB data sample has already been leaked to substantiate the claim.","## Executive Summary\nKenya's digital health ecosystem has been dealt a devastating blow by an alleged massive data breach at **[M-TIBA](https://m-tiba.co.ke/)**, a mobile health wallet operated by **CarePay** in partnership with **Safaricom**. A threat actor using the alias **Kazu** has claimed on dark web forums to have exfiltrated 2.15 terabytes of data, containing over 17 million files related to 4.8 million users. The breach exposes an enormous volume of highly sensitive Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The incident is particularly alarming as it occurred just two months after CarePay announced it had achieved ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification, raising serious questions about the effectiveness of its security controls. If confirmed, this stands as one of the most severe data breaches in Kenyan history.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe threat actor 'Kazu' announced the breach on dark web forums and a Telegram channel, releasing a 2GB sample file as proof of the hack. This sample alone reportedly contains the records of 114,000 individuals, including primary M-TIBA account holders and their dependents. The attacker's motives appear to be financial, as they are likely attempting to sell the massive database on underground markets. CarePay, the operator of M-TIBA, has stated it is 'actively investigating' the claims, while Kenya's Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) has acknowledged awareness of the incident.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThe breach appears to be a direct compromise of the backend infrastructure hosting the M-TIBA platform's data. The sheer volume of data (2.15 TB) suggests the attacker gained deep, persistent access to primary databases or file storage repositories. The leaked data allegedly includes:\n- **Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** Full names, national ID numbers, phone numbers, dates of birth.\n- **Protected Health Information (PHI):** Patient diagnoses, billing information, detailed treatment records, and even handwritten doctors' notes from approximately 700 different health facilities.\n\nThe attack vector has not been confirmed, but possibilities include:\n- [`T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/): A vulnerability in the M-TIBA web platform or its APIs.\n- [`T1530 - Data from Cloud Storage Object`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1530/): Misconfigured or compromised cloud storage buckets (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).\n- [`T1078 - Valid Accounts`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/): Use of stolen developer or administrator credentials.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe impact of this breach is catastrophic for the 4.8 million affected individuals and the broader Kenyan society.\n- **Risk to Individuals:** Victims are at extreme risk of identity theft, financial fraud, and highly targeted phishing attacks. The exposure of sensitive medical data, such as diagnoses, creates a significant threat of blackmail, extortion, and social stigma.\n- **Healthcare Sector Impact:** The breach severely undermines trust in Kenya's burgeoning digital health sector. Patients may become reluctant to share information with providers, and the 700 affected health facilities face their own legal and reputational crises.\n- **Regulatory Consequences:** CarePay and M-TIBA face significant regulatory scrutiny and potential fines from the ODPC under Kenya's Data Protection Act.\n- **National Security:** A database of this size containing the PII and health status of a significant portion of the population could be considered a national security risk if acquired by a foreign adversary.\n\n## IOCs\nNo specific Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) were provided in the source articles.\n\n## Detection & Response\nFor M-TIBA, the focus is now on incident response: determining the initial access vector, ejecting the threat actor, and assessing the full scope of the breach. For affected individuals, the response is focused on mitigating personal risk.\n1.  **Identity Theft Protection:** Affected users should be on high alert for phishing emails, SMS messages (smishing), and phone calls asking for personal information.\n2.  **Credit Monitoring:** While not as prevalent in Kenya as in other regions, monitoring financial accounts for fraudulent activity is crucial.\n3.  **Password Hygiene:** Although passwords were not explicitly mentioned, it is a best practice for all users to change passwords on any related accounts and enable **[Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)](https://www.cisa.gov/mfa)** wherever possible.\n\n## Mitigation\nThis breach serves as a stark reminder of the responsibilities that come with handling sensitive data.\n1.  **Data Encryption at Rest and in Transit:** All sensitive data, particularly PHI and PII, must be encrypted both when stored in databases and when transmitted over networks. Field-level encryption for the most sensitive data provides an additional layer of protection.\n2.  **Robust Access Controls:** Implement the principle of least privilege. Developers, administrators, and applications should only have access to the specific data they need to function. Access to production databases should be strictly controlled and monitored.\n3.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** ISO certification is a snapshot in time. Continuous security validation through regular, independent penetration tests and security audits is necessary to identify and remediate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.\n4.  **D3FEND Countermeasures:**\n    -   [`D3-FE: File Encryption`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:FileEncryption) and [`D3-DENCR: Disk Encryption`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:DiskEncryption) are fundamental for protecting data at rest.\n    -   [`D3-RAPA: Resource Access Pattern Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ResourceAccessPatternAnalysis) can help detect anomalous data access by an attacker, potentially identifying a breach in progress.","Huge data breach at Kenya's M-TIBA health platform! 🇰🇪 Hacker 'Kazu' claims to have stolen 2.15TB of data on 4.8M users, including sensitive medical records.

This means sensitive fields like 'national_id', 'phone_number', and 'diagnosis' should be individually encrypted within the database itself. The encryption keys must be managed in a separate, secure key management service (KMS) or hardware security module (HSM). This ensures that even if an attacker compromises the database server and exfiltrates the raw data files, as 'Kazu' likely did, the most sensitive information remains encrypted and useless without access to the keys.

A threat actor exfiltrating 2.15 TB of data would generate highly anomalous access patterns. Security teams should deploy tools (like a CASB for cloud environments or a DAM for on-prem databases) to baseline normal data access. Alerts should be configured for when a single user account or service principal accesses an abnormally high number of records, accesses data outside of normal business hours, or downloads data in bulk. An attacker like 'Kazu' querying millions of records and downloading terabytes of files would deviate massively from the behavior of a legitimate application process. Detecting this early could have allowed the security team to intervene, terminate the session, and prevent the full-scale exfiltration.","M1040",[],[],[13,130,131,132,133,19,27,134],"Healthcare","PHI","PII","Kenya","Dark Web","2025-10-28T15:00:00.000Z","NewsArticle",{"geographic_scope":138,"countries_affected":139,"industries_affected":140,"other_affected":141,"people_affected_estimate":144},"national",[133],[130],[142,143],"Customers of Safaricom","Patients of 700 health facilities","4.8 million users",5,{"articles":147,"totalCount":4565,"lastUpdated":4566},[148,171,187,204,223,239,250,266,283,297,313,325,338,351,363,376,390,404,417,431,446,462,476,490,503,518,534,547,562,572,583,595,609,618,627,643,655,667,678,689,700,712,726,742,755,768,782,796,807,818,830,843,856,868,882,895,908,922,934,947,961,973,986,1000,1014,1028,1039,1054,1066,1081,1097,1112,1126,1142,1154,1164,1176,1188,1201,1211,1224,1237,1250,1260,1273,1286,1298,1307,1320,1335,1346,1357,1370,1380,1390,1399,1410,1421,1434,1444,1453,1463,1474,1486,1499,1508,1519,1528,1537,1548,1559,1573,1585,1597,1610,1623,1638,1654,1665,1676,1692,1705,1717,1727,1739,1751,1765,1778,1793,1807,1821,1834,1846,1859,1871,1885,1895,1907,1918,1931,1943,1954,1963,1974,1984,1996,2009,2020,2034,2046,2056,2068,2080,2091,2099,2111,2124,2132,2143,2156,2166,2176,2187,2203,2213,2225,2236,2248,2258,2270,2281,2291,2303,2313,2323,2333,2341,2351,2365,2376,2384,2396,2404,2413,2423,2437,2447,2456,2469,2480,2495,2506,2516,2528,2538,2550,2562,2574,2584,2596,2605,2616,2627,2640,2652,2661,2673,2683,2694,2705,2718,2734,2744,2754,2765,2777,2790,2801,2814,2824,2835,2845,2854,2867,2879,2892,2905,2915,2927,2939,2951,2961,2973,2985,2996,3010,3014,3024,3035,3045,3056,3066,3078,3087,3098,3112,3122,3135,3143,3154,3165,3177,3186,3196,3208,3221,3234,3245,3260,3272,3282,3293,3303,3311,3321,3335,3347,3358,3368,3378,3389,3400,3412,3423,3436,3447,3461,3472,3486,3499,3511,3520,3531,3541,3550,3561,3572,3584,3595,3605,3619,3630,3642,3653,3666,3677,3691,3702,3714,3725,3735,3745,3755,3765,3776,3785,3797,3809,3821,3830,3843,3854,3865,3874,3884,3894,3904,3914,3925,3936,3946,3955,3967,3977,3991,4002,4012,4022,4031,4042,4052,4062,4075,4085,4095,4106,4116,4127,4138,4150,4162,4174,4184,4195,4207,4217,4228,4238,4248,4258,4267,4277,4289,4302,4312,4325,4335,4346,4355,4364,4373,4382,4391,4400,4410,4419,4430,4440,4451,4459,4468,4477,4487,4496,4507,4517,4528,4536,4545,4554],{"id":149,"slug":150,"headline":151,"title":152,"severity":153,"article_type":136,"excerpt":154,"tags":155,"categories":163,"createdAt":167,"updatedAt":167,"displayDate":168,"isUpdated":169,"readingTime":170},"16a3b9c1-b419-46c6-8641-5018be1a1539","cloudflare-outage-caused-by-botched-emergency-patch-for-react2shell","Cloudflare Outage Hits 28% of Global Traffic After Faulty React2Shell Patch","Cloudflare Confirms Global Outage Caused by Botched Emergency WAF Update to Mitigate React2Shell","high","Cloudflare, a leading internet infrastructure provider, experienced a 25-minute global outage on December 5, 2025, that impacted approximately 28% of its HTTP traffic and made numerous popular websites inaccessible.
