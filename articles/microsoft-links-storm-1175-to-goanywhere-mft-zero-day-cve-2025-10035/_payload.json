The flaw, CVE-2025-10035, is an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability with a perfect 10.0 CVSS score. Storm-1175 has been exploiting this zero-day since at least September 11, 2025, to compromise organizations in finance, healthcare, and technology, deploying backdoors and RMM tools before exfiltrating data and deploying ransomware.","## Executive Summary\n**[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/security)** Threat Intelligence has formally attributed the exploitation of a maximum-severity vulnerability in **[Fortra](https://www.fortra.com/)**'s GoAnywhere Managed File Transfer (MFT) solution to the financially motivated threat group **Storm-1175**. The vulnerability, tracked as **[CVE-2025-10035](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10035)**, is a deserialization flaw that allows for unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) and has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0. Storm-1175, the operator behind the **Medusa ransomware**, has been actively exploiting this flaw as a zero-day since mid-September 2025. The group uses the initial access to deploy backdoors, exfiltrate data, and ultimately encrypt victim networks, posing a critical threat to users of the affected software.\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe attack targets GoAnywhere MFT, a popular enterprise solution for secure file transfers. The **CVE-2025-10035** vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve a full system compromise without any authentication. Storm-1175 has weaponized this flaw to breach organizations across multiple sectors, including finance, healthcare, and technology. Their attack chain is methodical: gain access via the exploit, establish persistence using legitimate Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tools, move laterally, exfiltrate sensitive data, and then deploy the Medusa ransomware for double extortion. This follows a pattern of ransomware groups targeting MFT solutions, which are high-value targets due to the sensitive data they process and store.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n**CVE-2025-10035** is a deserialization vulnerability. An attacker can craft a malicious payload and send it to the server, disguised as a valid license response. When the server deserializes this malicious object, it leads to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the GoAnywhere MFT service. This provides a direct path to system compromise.\n\nOnce inside, Storm-1175's post-exploitation TTPs include:\n- **Persistence**: Deploying legitimate RMM tools like `SimpleHelp` and `MeshAgent`, and placing JSP backdoors in GoAnywhere web directories.\n- **Lateral Movement**: Using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move to other systems on the network.\n- **Data Exfiltration**: Leveraging the `Rclone` utility to copy large amounts of sensitive data to attacker-controlled cloud storage.\n- **Impact**: Deploying the **Medusa ransomware** to encrypt files on the compromised network.\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK Techniques\n- [`T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1210/): Specifically targeting the vulnerable GoAnywhere MFT service.\n- [`T1203 - Exploitation for Client Execution`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203/): The core of the attack, leveraging a deserialization flaw.\n- [`T1219 - Remote Access Software`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1219/): Using `SimpleHelp` and `MeshAgent` for persistent C2.\n- [`T1572 - Protocol Tunneling`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572/): RDP used for lateral movement.\n- [`T1567.002 - Exfiltration to Cloud Storage`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/002/): Using `Rclone` to steal data.\n- [`T1486 - Data Encrypted for Impact`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/): The final payload delivery of Medusa ransomware.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nA CVSS 10.0 vulnerability in a widely used MFT solution represents a worst-case scenario for affected organizations. Successful exploitation grants attackers complete control over a system designed to handle a company's most sensitive data transfers. The consequences include immediate data breach, massive operational disruption from ransomware, significant financial costs for recovery and potential ransom payments, and severe reputational damage. The targeting of finance and healthcare sectors raises the stakes, with potential for regulatory penalties under frameworks like HIPAA and GLBA.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| file_name | `SimpleHelp.exe`, `MeshAgent.exe` | Presence of these legitimate RMM tools in unexpected locations or on MFT servers. |\n| file_name | `*.jsp` | Look for newly created or modified JSP files in the GoAnywhere web directories, which could be backdoors. |\n| process_name | `rclone.exe` | The execution of the Rclone tool on servers is a major red flag for data exfiltration. |\n| network_traffic_pattern | Connections to `mega.nz`, `pcloud.com` | Rclone is often configured to exfiltrate data to these and other cloud storage providers. |\n| log_source | `GoAnywhere MFT Audit Logs` | Review for anomalous license update activities or errors that could indicate an exploit attempt. |\n\n## Detection & Response\n1.  **Vulnerability Scanning**: Immediately scan your environment for vulnerable instances of GoAnywhere MFT. Prioritize internet-facing systems.\n2.  **Log and Network Monitoring**: Monitor for the IOCs listed above. Pay close attention to outbound network traffic from MFT servers to cloud storage providers. Use D3FEND's [`Network Traffic Analysis (D3-NTA)`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkTrafficAnalysis) to spot anomalous connections.\n3.  **File Integrity Monitoring**: Implement FIM on GoAnywhere MFT servers to detect the creation of suspicious JSP files or the presence of tools like `Rclone`, `SimpleHelp`, or `MeshAgent`.\n4.  **Process Monitoring**: Use an EDR to monitor for the execution of these tools and alert security teams immediately. This aligns with D3FEND's [`Process Analysis (D3-PA)`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ProcessAnalysis).\n\n## Mitigation\n1.  **Patch Immediately**: Apply the patch provided by Fortra in GoAnywhere MFT version 7.8.4. This is the most critical step and falls under D3FEND's [`Software Update (D3-SU)`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SoftwareUpdate).\n2.  **Reduce Attack Surface**: If patching is delayed, restrict access to the GoAnywhere MFT web interface to trusted IP addresses only. Do not expose the administrative interface to the public internet. This is a form of D3FEND's [`Inbound Traffic Filtering (D3-ITF)`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:InboundTrafficFiltering).\n3.  **Egress Filtering**: Block outbound traffic from MFT servers to known cloud storage providers and other destinations not required for legitimate business operations. This can prevent or disrupt the data exfiltration stage.\n4.  **Application Control**: Use application allowlisting to prevent the execution of unauthorized software like `Rclone` and RMM tools on MFT servers.","ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Microsoft links Storm-1175 (Medusa ransomware) to active exploitation of a 10.0 CVSS zero-day in Fortra's GoAnywhere MFT (CVE-2025-10035).
