According to recent reports, threat actors compromise carrier systems, often using legitimate Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tools like ScreenConnect. Once inside, they manipulate digital 'load boards' to bid on and win real shipments. They then reroute the cargo to a location controlled by organized crime partners, leading to the theft of entire truckloads of goods. This trend highlights a critical vulnerability where the digital transformation of the logistics industry is being exploited to cause billions in real-world losses.","## Executive Summary\nA sophisticated and growing threat is blurring the lines between cybercrime and physical crime, with threat actors systematically targeting the logistics and transportation industry to orchestrate large-scale cargo theft. Recent research details a methodology where attackers infiltrate trucking and freight companies, often using social engineering to deploy legitimate Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tools like **ScreenConnect** and **PDQ Connect**. With this digital foothold, the criminals gain access to the carrier's operational platforms and digital 'load boards.' They then use this access to divert real, high-value shipments to locations where organized crime associates are waiting to steal the physical goods. This cyber-enabled approach is reportedly responsible for a significant portion of the estimated $35 billion lost annually to cargo theft in the U.S., posing a major threat to the global supply chain.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\nThis hybrid attack represents a significant evolution in cargo theft, moving from traditional strong-arm tactics to sophisticated digital manipulation. The core of the threat is the exploitation of the trust and efficiency of modern digital logistics platforms.\n\nThe attack chain typically unfolds as follows:\n1.  **Initial Compromise**: Attackers compromise accounts on 'load boards'—digital marketplaces that connect shippers with carriers.\n2.  **Social Engineering**: They post fraudulent listings. When a legitimate carrier responds, the attackers send a phishing email with a link that installs a legitimate RMM tool on the carrier's system.\n3.  **Digital Intrusion**: Using the RMM tool ([`T1219 - Remote Access Software`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1219/)), the attackers gain persistent access to the carrier's computers and, by extension, their logistics management software.\n4.  **Shipment Hijacking**: The attackers monitor the carrier's activity, bid on legitimate, high-value shipments (e.g., electronics, pharmaceuticals), and win the contract.\n5.  **Physical Theft**: Once in control of the shipment's logistics, they alter the destination address in the system, rerouting the truck to a drop-off point controlled by their criminal partners, where the cargo is stolen.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThe technical linchpin of this operation is the abuse of legitimate RMM software. These tools are designed for IT administrators to remotely manage systems, so they are often trusted and may not be flagged by traditional antivirus software. By using tools like **ScreenConnect**, attackers gain the same level of control as an administrator, allowing them to:\n-   Observe user activity to learn operational procedures.\n-   Access saved credentials for logistics platforms.\n-   Directly manipulate shipping manifests and destination details.\n-   Cover their tracks by deleting logs or disabling security software.\n\nThis is a classic 'living off the land' (LotL) technique, where attackers use tools already present or accepted in the environment to achieve their objectives, making detection more difficult. The initial access vector relies on standard social engineering and phishing ([`T1566 - Phishing`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/)).\n\n## Impact Assessment\n-   **Direct Financial Loss**: The most obvious impact is the loss of the stolen goods, which can be worth millions of dollars per shipment. These losses are often passed on to consumers through higher prices and insurance premiums.\n-   **Supply Chain Disruption**: Hijacked shipments can lead to significant delays and disruptions for manufacturers and retailers who rely on just-in-time delivery.\n-   **Reputational Damage**: Logistics companies that fall victim to these schemes suffer damage to their reputation, potentially losing major contracts with shippers.\n-   **Increased Operational Costs**: The industry faces increased costs for insurance, security measures, and more rigorous vetting processes for carriers and shippers.\n\n## IOCs\nNo specific Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) were provided in the source articles.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n| Type | Value | Description | Context | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| process_name | `ScreenConnect.Client.exe`, `PDQConnect.exe` | Execution of legitimate RMM tools that are not part of the organization's standard toolset. | Monitor process creation events. Maintain an allowlist of approved RMM software. | high |\n| network_traffic_pattern | Outbound connections to known RMM service domains (e.g., `*.screenconnect.com`). | A sign that an RMM tool has been installed and is connecting back to its control server. | Monitor DNS queries and firewall logs for connections to RMM provider domains. | high |\n| log_source | `Logistics Platform Audit Logs` | Changes to a shipment's destination address made by an unusual user account or at an odd time. | Implement and monitor audit logs within all freight management applications. | high |\n\n## Detection & Response\n1.  **Monitor for Unauthorized RMMs**: Use an EDR or application control solution to detect and block the installation and execution of any RMM software that is not explicitly approved by the IT department. This is a form of **[D3-EDL: Executable Denylisting](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ExecutableDenylisting)**.\n2.  **Behavioral Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious behaviors, such as a user account suddenly accessing the system from a new geographic location or making changes to shipping data outside of normal business hours.\n3.  **Audit Log Review**: Regularly review audit logs from freight management platforms for any unauthorized or suspicious changes, particularly to delivery destinations.\n4.  **User-Reported Phishing**: Foster a culture where employees feel comfortable immediately reporting any suspicious emails or requests, especially those related to load board interactions.\n\n## Mitigation\n1.  **User Training**: Train all staff, especially dispatchers and those who interact with load boards, to recognize and report phishing attempts. Emphasize that they should never click links or download files from unknown or untrusted sources.\n2.  **Application Allowlisting**: Implement application allowlisting to prevent the execution of unauthorized software, including unapproved RMM tools.\n3.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enforce MFA on all logistics platforms, load boards, and email accounts to prevent account takeover, even if credentials are stolen. This is a critical **[D3-MFA: Multi-factor Authentication](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:Multi-factorAuthentication)** control.\n4.  **Process Controls**: Implement business process controls, such as requiring a secondary verification or a phone call for any change to a shipment's final destination, especially for high-value cargo.","A new trend in crime: Hackers infiltrate logistics firms using RMM tools, then divert real-world cargo shipments for physical theft, causing billions in losses. 🚚💻 #Cybercrime #SupplyChain #Logistics #Theft","Cybercriminals are targeting the logistics industry by using RMM tools to infiltrate carrier systems and divert physical cargo shipments, blending cybercrime with real-world theft in a growing trend.",[13,14,15],"Cyberattack","Supply Chain Attack","Threat Intelligence","high",[18,21],{"name":19,"type":20},"ScreenConnect","product",{"name":22,"type":20},"PDQ Connect",[],[25,30,34],{"url":26,"title":27,"date":28,"friendly_name":29},"https://www.pymnts.com/cybersecurity/2025/cargo-theft-goes-digital-as-cybercrime-invades-the-supply-chain/","Cargo Theft Goes Digital as Cybercrime Invades the Supply Chain","2025-11-06","PYMNTS.com",{"url":31,"title":32,"date":28,"friendly_name":33},"https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-intelligence/2025/11/hackers-help-organized-crime-groups-in-cargo-freight-heists/","Hackers commit highway robbery, stealing cargo and goods","Malwarebytes",{"url":35,"title":36,"date":37,"friendly_name":38},"https://thecyberexpress.com/cybercriminals-and-cargo-freight-heists/","Cybercriminals Exploit Remote Monitoring Tools to Infiltrate Logistics and Freight Networks","2025-11-03","The Cyber Express",[],[41,45,49],{"id":42,"name":43,"tactic":44},"T1219","Remote Access Software","Command and Control",{"id":46,"name":47,"tactic":48},"T1566","Phishing","Initial Access",{"id":50,"name":51,"tactic":44},"T1572","Protocol Tunneling",[53,63,67],{"id":54,"name":55,"d3fend_techniques":56,"description":61,"domain":62},"M1033","Limit Software Installation",[57],{"id":58,"name":59,"url":60},"D3-EAL","Executable Allowlisting","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ExecutableAllowlisting","Use application control or allowlisting to prevent the installation and execution of unauthorized software, including unapproved RMM tools.","enterprise",{"id":64,"name":65,"description":66,"domain":62},"M1017","User Training","Train employees to recognize and report phishing attempts, which are the primary initial access vector for installing the malicious RMM software.",{"id":68,"name":69,"d3fend_techniques":70,"description":74,"domain":62},"M1032","Multi-factor Authentication",[71],{"id":72,"name":69,"url":73},"D3-MFA","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:Multi-factorAuthentication","Enforce MFA on all logistics platforms and email accounts to prevent account takeover, even if an attacker manages to steal credentials.",[76,78],{"technique_id":58,"technique_name":59,"url":60,"recommendation":77,"mitre_mitigation_id":54},"To directly counter the core tactic of this cyber-enabled theft, logistics companies must implement Executable Allowlisting. This involves creating a definitive list of all software and applications that are authorized to run on company systems. Any application not on this list, including unapproved RMM tools like ScreenConnect or PDQ Connect (if not used by the company's IT department), will be blocked from executing. This can be achieved using technologies like Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC). By preventing the malicious RMM tool from ever running, the attacker's entire chain of attack is broken at the execution stage. This is far more effective than relying on antivirus, as the RMM tools themselves are legitimate software and won't be flagged as malware.

This creates a significant barrier to account takeover. Furthermore, business processes should be updated to require a secondary out-of-band verification (such as a phone call) for any high-risk changes, such as altering a shipment's final destination address.
