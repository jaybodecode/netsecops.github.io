The attackers are exploiting the critical remote code execution vulnerability CVE-2023-20198 (CVSS 10.0) to gain full control of routers and switches. The ASD reports a recent spike in activity, with 150 Australian devices infected in October 2025 alone. The malware, a non-persistent web shell, is being actively redeployed by attackers even after removal.","## Executive Summary\nThe **[Australian Signals Directorate (ASD)](https://www.asd.gov.au/)** has released a high-priority alert regarding a new malware implant named **BADCANDY** that is being actively deployed against unpatched **[Cisco](https://www.cisco.com)** IOS XE devices in Australia. The attackers are exploiting **CVE-2023-20198**, a maximum-severity (CVSS 10.0) vulnerability that allows for unauthenticated remote code execution. The campaign has shown a recent surge, with the ASD identifying 150 compromised devices in October 2025, bringing the total to approximately 400 since July 2025. The **BADCANDY** implant is a Lua-based web shell that gives attackers persistent access as long as the device is not rebooted. The attackers have been observed reinfecting devices after the implant is removed, indicating a persistent and determined adversary.\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n-   **CVE-2023-20198**: This critical vulnerability resides in the web UI feature of Cisco IOS XE software. It allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to create a local user account with privilege level 15 (full administrative access) and gain complete control of the device. The vulnerability was first disclosed and exploited in late 2023, with China-linked groups like **Salt Typhoon** using it to compromise telecommunications infrastructure.\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe current campaign involves the deployment of the **BADCANDY** implant. This malware is a Lua-based web shell that is written to the device's file system. It allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised device. A key tactic observed by the ASD is that after deploying BADCANDY, the attackers apply a non-persistent patch to the device's web server in memory. This masks the device from being detected by scanners looking for **CVE-2023-20198**, giving the device owner a false sense of security. However, the presence of the implant itself is definitive proof of compromise.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n-   **Initial Access ([`T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/))**: The attackers gain initial access by exploiting **CVE-2023-20198** on unpatched, internet-facing Cisco IOS XE devices.\n-   **Persistence ([`T1505.003 - Server Software Component: Web Shell`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/003/))**: The **BADCANDY** implant is installed, which functions as a web shell, providing the attacker with a persistent method to execute commands via HTTP/S requests.\n-   **Defense Evasion ([`T1562.007 - Disable or Modify Tools`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/007/))**: The attackers patch the vulnerability in memory post-exploitation. This is a clever defense evasion tactic designed to thwart vulnerability scanners.\n-   **Non-Persistence**: The BADCANDY implant and the in-memory patch do not survive a reboot. However, the ASD has observed that the attackers are actively monitoring their implants and will quickly reinfect a device if it is rebooted but not properly patched.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nCompromise of network infrastructure devices like routers and switches is extremely serious. An attacker with full control over these devices can:\n-   Monitor, redirect, or modify network traffic passing through the device.\n-   Use the compromised device as a pivot point to launch further attacks into the internal network.\n-   Disrupt network operations, causing outages.\n-   Maintain long-term, stealthy persistence within a target's perimeter.\nThe targeting of telecommunications providers and other critical infrastructure operators poses a national security risk.\n\n## Detection Methods\n-   **Cisco's `check-integrity.py` script**: Cisco has provided a script to check for the presence of the implant. This should be run on all suspect devices.\n-   **Manual Inspection**: Administrators can check for the presence of the BADCANDY implant by running the command `show running-config | include ip http active-session-modules`. The presence of `badcandy` indicates a compromise.\n-   **Network Traffic Analysis**: Monitor for unusual HTTP/S requests to the device's web UI, especially those that do not align with normal administrative activity.\n\n## Remediation Steps\n1.  **Patch Immediately ([`M1051 - Update Software`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1051/))**: The only definitive solution is to upgrade all Cisco IOS XE devices to a patched software version as recommended in the Cisco security advisory.\n2.  **Disable Web UI**: If the web UI is not required for business purposes, disable it on all internet-facing devices to completely remove the attack surface. This can be done with the command `no ip http server` or `no ip http secure-server`.\n3.  **Assume Breach**: If a device was vulnerable and exposed to the internet, assume it has been compromised. Follow incident response procedures, which should include wiping the device and restoring from a known-good configuration after patching.\n4.  **Restrict Access**: Limit access to the web UI to a dedicated management network and trusted IP addresses only.","🇦🇺 Australia's ASD warns of 'BADCANDY' malware attacks on Cisco IOS XE devices.
