The breach, which occurred in October 2025, originated from the party's \"TISZA Világ\" service. The compromised dataset, containing 198,500 records, has been added to the Have I Been Pwned service. Exposed information includes supporters' full names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, and usernames. This incident places affected individuals at significant risk of phishing, fraud, and other malicious targeting.","## Executive Summary\nA significant data breach has impacted the Hungarian political party, **TISZA**, exposing the personally identifiable information (PII) of approximately 198,500 of its supporters. The breach originated from the party's \"TISZA Világ\" service in October 2025, with the data being widely circulated online in November 2025. The breach has been indexed by the **[Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com)** notification service. The leaked data is extensive, including full names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, and usernames. This exposure creates a substantial risk for the affected individuals, who may now be targeted in sophisticated phishing campaigns, identity theft, and other fraudulent activities.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\nThis is a classic data breach incident resulting in the public disclosure of sensitive personal information. The key details are:\n- **Victim:** TISZA, a political party in Hungary.\n- **Source of Breach:** The party's \"TISZA Világ\" service.\n- **Data Exposed:** A comprehensive set of PII for 198,500 individuals.\n- **Timeline:** The breach occurred in October 2025 and was discovered to be circulating online in November 2025.\n\nThe motivation behind the attack is unknown but could range from politically motivated hacktivism to opportunistic cybercrime. Regardless of the motive, the outcome is a large-scale privacy violation with serious potential consequences.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nWhile the exact method of the breach is not specified, attacks on web applications like the \"TISZA Világ\" service typically involve one of the following techniques:\n1.  **[`T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/):** The attackers may have exploited a vulnerability, such as SQL injection or a remote code execution flaw, in the web application or its underlying components.\n2.  **[`T1078 - Valid Accounts`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/):** The compromise of an administrative account through phishing or credential stuffing could have granted the attackers direct access to the database.\n3.  **[`T1595.002 - Vulnerability Scanning`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595/002/):** Attackers likely scanned the application for known vulnerabilities to identify an entry point.\n\nOnce access to the database was achieved, the attackers would have exfiltrated the data ([`T1005 - Data from Local System`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005/)), likely in a single compressed file, before leaking it online.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe impact on the 198,500 affected supporters is severe:\n- **Phishing and Scams:** The leaked data is a goldmine for criminals. They can craft highly convincing, personalized phishing emails (spearphishing) using the victims' names, addresses, and political affiliation to trick them into revealing financial information or installing malware.\n- **Identity Theft:** With names, addresses, and phone numbers, criminals can attempt to open fraudulent accounts or commit other forms of identity theft.\n- **Harassment and Doxing:** As the data pertains to political affiliation, individuals could be targeted for online or physical harassment by political opponents.\n- **Regulatory Scrutiny:** The TISZA party will likely face investigation and potential fines under **[GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)** for failing to adequately protect the personal data of EU citizens.\n\n## Detection & Response\nFor organizations, detecting a breach of this nature involves:\n- **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A properly configured WAF can detect and block common web attack techniques like SQL injection.\n- **Database Activity Monitoring (DAM):** DAM tools can alert on unusual database queries, such as a request to select all records from a user table.\n- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** FIM on the web server can detect the creation of webshells or other malicious files.\n\nFor affected individuals, the response should be:\n- **Password Hygiene:** Change the password on any other account that may have used the same email and password combination.\n- **Enable MFA:** Enable **[Multi-factor Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication)** on all sensitive accounts, especially email.\n- **Be Vigilant:** Be extremely cautious of unsolicited emails, text messages, and phone calls.\n\n## Mitigation\nTo prevent such breaches, organizations handling PII must implement fundamental security controls:\n\n1.  **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC):** Build security into the application from the ground up. This includes regular code reviews and security testing (SAST/DAST) to identify and fix vulnerabilities before deployment.\n2.  **Vulnerability Management:** Continuously scan web applications and their infrastructure for vulnerabilities and patch them promptly. This aligns with [`D3-SU: Software Update`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SoftwareUpdate).\n3.  **Access Control:** Enforce the principle of least privilege for all accounts with access to the production environment and database. Administrative access should be protected with MFA.\n4.  **Data Encryption:** All sensitive PII should be encrypted at rest in the database and in transit over the network. This is a core requirement of [`D3-FE: File Encryption`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:FileEncryption). While it may not prevent the breach itself if application-level access is gained, it adds a critical layer of defense.","🇭🇺 DATA BREACH: The personal data of nearly 200,000 supporters of the Hungarian political party TISZA has been leaked online.

More importantly, these accounts must be protected by Multi-factor Authentication (MFA). This ensures that even if an attacker obtains an administrator's password through phishing or a separate breach, they cannot gain access without the second factor. For the public-facing supporter accounts, the system should enforce password complexity requirements and offer MFA as an option to users, while also checking all new passwords against a list of known-compromised passwords to prevent reuse.","M1027",[],[109,114,118],{"type":110,"value":111,"description":112,"context":113,"confidence":14},"log_source","Web Application Firewall (WAF) Logs","WAF logs should be monitored for signs of SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or other common web attack vectors against the 'TISZA Világ' service.","SIEM or security analytics platform.",{"type":110,"value":115,"description":116,"context":117,"confidence":14},"Database Audit Logs","Anomalous queries, such as a 'SELECT *' from the main user table, or access from an unfamiliar source IP, could indicate a breach.","Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) solution or SIEM.",{"type":119,"value":120,"description":121,"context":122,"confidence":123},"network_traffic_pattern","Large data egress from database server","A large, single outbound data transfer from the database server to an unknown destination is a strong indicator of data exfiltration.","Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) or firewall logs.","medium",[13,125,126,127,128,20],"PII","Hungary","Politics","GDPR","2025-11-08T15:00:00.000Z","NewsArticle",{"geographic_scope":132,"countries_affected":133,"industries_affected":134,"people_affected_estimate":136},"national",[126],[135],"Government","198,500",[138,139,20,140,141,142],"TISZA data breach","Hungarian political party","PII leak","cybersecurity Hungary","TISZA Világ",4,{"articles":145,"totalCount":2906,"lastUpdated":2907},[146,167,181,197,214,230,241,257,272,290,301,312,326,346,360,373,376,391,404,418,433,449,462,475,487,499,509,521,536,547,560,573,582,592,604,621,633,642,656,668,684,698,710,723,735,748,763,776,788,802,813,825,838,852,864,875,888,898,909,921,934,953,963,975,986,1000,1014,1027,1040,1051,1065,1077,1089,1104,1116,1129,1142,1152,1166,1180,1194,1204,1216,1228,1241,1255,1268,1278,1289,1303,1314,1326,1339,1348,1360,1374,1384,1398,1407,1420,1431,1442,1454,1463,1474,1486,1500,1513,1525,1540,1553,1563,1574,1584,1593,1604,1620,1632,1645,1655,1666,1677,1688,1700,1711,1724,1735,1750,1762,1776,1789,1801,1810,1822,1834,1847,1856,1867,1878,1890,1901,1912,1927,1939,1951,1962,1975,1986,2000,2012,2024,2035,2046,2056,2066,2077,2088,2098,2110,2122,2136,2145,2158,2169,2180,2189,2199,2210,2220,2231,2243,2255,2265,2275,2287,2297,2311,2323,2333,2344,2353,2365,2375,2385,2398,2408,2418,2431,2441,2454,2465,2477,2489,2501,2512,2523,2535,2545,2557,2567,2577,2587,2597,2607,2619,2633,2643,2656,2667,2678,2687,2698,2708,2717,2726,2735,2746,2755,2766,2776,2787,2795,2804,2814,2824,2835,2846,2857,2868,2876,2885,2895],{"id":147,"slug":148,"headline":149,"title":150,"severity":151,"article_type":130,"excerpt":152,"tags":153,"categories":161,"createdAt":163,"updatedAt":163,"displayDate":164,"isUpdated":165,"readingTime":166},"9ca70d79-c7b4-4080-b1ad-2a308919e5ac","chinese-firm-knownsec-breached-exposing-state-hacking-tools-and-global-target-lists","China's Cyber Arsenal Exposed: Knownsec Breach Leaks State Hacking Tools and Global Target Lists","Catastrophic Breach at Chinese Cybersecurity Firm Knownsec Exposes State-Sponsored Hacking Tools and Global Surveillance Targets","critical","A monumental data breach at Knownsec, a prominent Chinese cybersecurity firm with close government ties, has resulted in the exposure of over 12,000 classified documents.
