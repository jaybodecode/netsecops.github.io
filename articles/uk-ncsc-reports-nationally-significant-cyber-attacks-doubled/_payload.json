The agency handled 204 'nationally significant' incidents in the past year, more than double the 89 from the previous year. Ransomware remains the most acute threat, particularly to the UK's Critical National Infrastructure (CNI). The report highlights a growing gap between the escalating threats from APTs and cybercriminals and the nation's collective defenses, prompting the NCSC to urge all UK businesses to make cyber resilience a board-level priority and adopt foundational security controls.","## Executive Summary\nThe United Kingdom's **[National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/)**, part of **[GCHQ](https://www.gchq.gov.uk/)**, has published its 2025 Annual Review, painting a grim picture of the evolving threat landscape. The report, released on October 14, 2025, indicates that the NCSC managed 204 'nationally significant' cyber incidents in the 12 months leading up to September 2025. This figure represents a 129% increase from the 89 incidents handled in the prior year, averaging four major attacks per week. The NCSC warns that the gap between the scale of cyber threats and the UK's national defenses is widening, and calls for urgent action from businesses to improve their resilience.\n\n---\n\n## Regulatory Details\nThe NCSC Annual Review serves as a key report on the state of the UK's cybersecurity. Key findings include:\n-   **Total Incidents:** 429 incidents were managed in total.\n-   **Nationally Significant Incidents:** 204 incidents were classified as nationally significant.\n-   **Highly Significant Incidents:** 18 incidents were deemed 'highly significant,' posing a serious threat to essential services or national interests.\n-   **Primary Threat:** Ransomware continues to be the most immediate and disruptive threat, especially to the UK's Critical National Infrastructure (CNI).\n-   **Threat Actors:** A substantial portion of incidents were attributed to Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups and sophisticated, financially motivated cybercriminals.\n\n## Affected Organizations\nThe report highlights that threats are impacting organizations of all sizes across the UK. Specific examples or sectors mentioned include:\n-   **Critical National Infrastructure (CNI):** Remains a primary target for ransomware and state-sponsored actors.\n-   **Retail:** High-profile attacks like the one on the **Co-op** by the **DragonForce** ransomware group, which led to service disruption and data theft from 6.5 million members.\n-   **FTSE350 Companies:** The government is specifically urging these large corporations to treat cybersecurity as a board-level responsibility.\n-   **Small Organizations:** The NCSC has launched a 'Cyber Action Toolkit' to help smaller businesses implement basic, effective controls.\n\n## Compliance Requirements & Guidance\nThe NCSC is not a regulator in the traditional sense, but it provides strong guidance and frameworks that are becoming de facto standards for due diligence.\n-   **Cyber Essentials:** The NCSC strongly promotes its Cyber Essentials scheme, a set of foundational technical controls. The report claims that certified organizations are 92% less likely to make a cyber insurance claim.\n-   **Board-Level Responsibility:** A ministerial letter accompanying the report urges company boards to take direct ownership of cyber risk management.\n-   **Cyber Action Toolkit:** A new resource designed to provide simple, actionable steps for small businesses and sole traders to improve their security posture.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe doubling of nationally significant incidents indicates that both the volume and impact of cyber attacks on the UK are increasing at an 'alarming pace.' This trend strains national response capabilities and puts essential services at greater risk. For businesses, the message is clear: the likelihood of experiencing a disruptive cyber attack is higher than ever, and the consequences can affect 'business survival.' The economic impact includes costs from business interruption, data recovery, ransom payments, and reputational damage.\n\n## Enforcement & Penalties\nWhile the NCSC itself does not issue fines, incidents it manages often fall under the jurisdiction of regulators like the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which can levy significant penalties for data breaches under UK GDPR. The report's findings will likely lead to increased scrutiny from regulators, insurers, and investors regarding organizations' cyber risk management practices.\n\n## Compliance Guidance\n1.  **Adopt Cyber Essentials:** All UK organizations, regardless of size, should pursue certification under the Cyber Essentials scheme as a baseline for cyber hygiene.\n2.  **Elevate to the Board:** Cyber risk should be a regular agenda item at the board level, with clear ownership assigned to a senior executive.\n3.  **Assume a Breach Mentality:** Develop and regularly test an incident response plan. The question is not *if* an attack will occur, but *when*.\n4.  **Implement Foundational Controls:** Prioritize basic but effective security measures, including **[Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/multi-factor-authentication)**, regular software patching ([`M1051 - Update Software`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1051/)), and maintaining secure, offline backups to counter the ransomware threat.","UK's NCSC annual report reveals 'nationally significant' cyber attacks more than doubled to 204 last year. 🇬🇧 Ransomware remains the top threat to critical infrastructure.

This allows security teams to detect an attacker's presence early in the cyber kill chain, often during the initial reconnaissance or lateral movement phase, long before they can deploy ransomware. This provides invaluable time to respond and evict the attacker before significant damage occurs, directly addressing the NCSC's concern about the growing threat to CNI.","M1056",[],[],[39,112,113,15,114,14,115],"UK","Cyberattack","Threat Intelligence","CNI","2025-10-15T15:00:00.000Z","Report",{"geographic_scope":119,"countries_affected":120,"industries_affected":122},"national",[121],"United Kingdom",[123,124,125,126,127],"Critical Infrastructure","Government","Retail","Finance","Healthcare","2025-10-15",5,"2025-10-30T00:00:00Z",[132],{"update_id":133,"update_date":130,"datetime":130,"title":134,"summary":135,"sources":136},"update-1","Update 1","UK government proposes ransomware payment ban for public sector/CNI and mandatory incident reporting following NCSC's report.",[137,140],{"title":138,"url":139},"Escalating UK cyber-attacks and a shifting legislative landscape: what organisations need to know","https://www.farrer.co.uk/news-and-insights/escalating-uk-cyber-attacks-and-a-shifting-legislative-landscape-what-organisations-need-to-know/",{"title":141,"url":142},"Rethinking Insurance In An Era Of Systemic Digital Risk","https://www.cybersecurity-intelligence.com/insights/rethinking-insurance-in-an-era-of-systemic-digital-risk",{"articles":144,"totalCount":3876,"lastUpdated":3877},[145,166,181,198,216,232,251,268,285,303,319,330,345,358,373,386,399,416,431,442,456,470,483,495,508,524,539,551,564,577,588,599,609,620,632,646,658,667,678,689,701,714,723,734,745,754,765,776,790,802,816,830,843,858,872,890,901,913,929,944,957,968,981,994,1008,1021,1037,1052,1066,1081,1094,1108,1120,1136,1146,1157,1168,1181,1194,1206,1215,1226,1236,1246,1258,1271,1284,1298,1310,1320,1332,1345,1357,1366,1379,1392,1400,1411,1425,1435,1445,1457,1473,1483,1496,1507,1519,1529,1541,1552,1562,1574,1585,1596,1606,1615,1626,1640,1651,1659,1672,1680,1689,1699,1713,1723,1732,1745,1756,1772,1783,1794,1806,1818,1830,1844,1857,1867,1880,1889,1900,1913,1927,1938,1948,1961,1971,1982,1993,2006,2022,2032,2042,2053,2066,2080,2091,2104,2114,2125,2135,2145,2158,2170,2183,2196,2206,2218,2222,2236,2246,2258,2270,2281,2295,2306,2316,2327,2339,2350,2360,2373,2382,2393,2407,2417,2430,2438,2449,2460,2472,2481,2492,2504,2517,2530,2541,2556,2569,2579,2590,2600,2609,2619,2634,2646,2657,2667,2677,2688,2699,2711,2722,2735,2746,2761,2772,2786,2799,2811,2820,2831,2842,2851,2862,2873,2885,2896,2906,2920,2931,2943,2954,2967,2978,2992,3003,3015,3026,3037,3047,3057,3067,3078,3087,3099,3111,3124,3133,3146,3157,3168,3177,3187,3198,3208,3219,3230,3241,3251,3260,3272,3282,3295,3307,3317,3327,3336,3347,3357,3367,3380,3390,3400,3412,3422,3433,3444,3456,3468,3480,3490,3501,3513,3523,3534,3544,3554,3564,3573,3583,3595,3609,3619,3632,3642,3653,3662,3672,3682,3691,3700,3709,3719,3728,3739,3749,3760,3768,3777,3786,3796,3806,3817,3827,3838,3846,3855,3865],{"id":146,"slug":147,"headline":148,"title":149,"severity":150,"article_type":151,"excerpt":152,"tags":153,"categories":161,"createdAt":162,"updatedAt":162,"displayDate":163,"isUpdated":164,"readingTime":165},"963a1f54-78eb-42c0-905e-29ac86efa63b","us-emergency-alert-system-codered-crippled-by-inc-ransom-attack","CodeRED Emergency Alert System Crippled by 'Inc Ransom' Attack, Disrupting US Public Safety","Inc Ransom Attack on OnSolve Disables CodeRED Emergency Alert System Across the United States","high","NewsArticle","The OnSolve CodeRED emergency alert system, a critical communication tool for hundreds of U.S. municipalities, has been taken offline following a ransomware attack claimed by the 'Inc Ransom' group.
