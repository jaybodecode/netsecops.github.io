According to researchers at Proofpoint, attackers clone an executive's voice from public audio samples and then use it in a vishing (voice phishing) call to a subordinate employee. The deepfake voice creates a sense of urgency, tricking the employee into entering their credentials on a fake site and then approving the subsequent MFA push notification sent to their device. This highly convincing technique circumvents the protection offered by many common MFA methods, leading to full account takeover. The campaign has already resulted in successful breaches and financial fraud, highlighting the emerging threat of AI-weaponized social engineering.","## Executive Summary\nSecurity researchers at **[Proofpoint](https://www.proofpoint.com/)** have uncovered a highly advanced phishing campaign, dubbed 'SilentVoice', that leverages AI-generated deepfake audio to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA). Attackers are targeting corporate employees by impersonating senior executives over the phone using cloned voices. The goal is to socially engineer the employee into approving an MFA push notification, thereby granting the attackers access to critical corporate accounts. The campaign starts with public audio clips of an executive, which are used to train an AI voice model. The attacker then calls an employee, using the deepfake voice to create a convincing and urgent scenario that manipulates the target into compromising their account. This attack vector demonstrates a significant evolution in social engineering, effectively neutralizing common forms of MFA and leading to successful, high-impact breaches.\n\n## Threat Overview\n-   **Campaign Name:** SilentVoice\n-   **Attack Type:** Vishing (Voice Phishing) combined with Credential Harvesting and MFA Bypass.\n-   **Key Technology:** AI Voice Cloning / Deepfake Audio.\n-   **Objective:** Account Takeover, Financial Fraud, Data Exfiltration.\n\nThe SilentVoice campaign represents a new level of sophistication in social engineering. It combines reconnaissance, AI technology, and real-time interaction to defeat both human vigilance and technical controls.\n\n### Attack Chain\n1.  **Reconnaissance:** Attackers gather information on a company's hierarchy from public sources like LinkedIn and find public audio or video clips of a target executive ([`T1591.002 - Business Relationships`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1591/002/)).\n2.  **Weaponization:** They use an AI voice cloning service to create a realistic deepfake model of the executive's voice from the audio samples.\n3.  **Delivery & Exploitation:** The attacker calls a targeted employee. Using the deepfake voice, they impersonate the executive, create a pretext of urgency (e.g., \"I'm locked out and need to approve a payment\"), and direct the employee to a credential harvesting website ([`T1566.004 - Spearphishing Voice`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/004/)).\n4.  **MFA Bypass:** The employee enters their credentials on the fake site. The attackers immediately use these credentials on the legitimate service, which triggers a real MFA prompt (e.g., a push notification) on the employee's phone. The deepfake voice then pressures the employee to approve the request ([`T1621 - Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1621/)).\n5.  **Actions on Objectives:** Once the MFA prompt is approved, the attackers have full access to the account and can proceed with their objectives, such as fraudulent wire transfers or data theft.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThis attack is less about technical exploits and more about the masterful manipulation of human psychology, augmented by technology. The use of a convincing, AI-generated voice of a known authority figure (a CEO or CFO) dramatically increases the likelihood of success. It bypasses the typical visual cues that might reveal an email phishing attempt and preys on an employee's willingness to help a superior, especially in a seemingly urgent situation. The primary technical component is the AI voice cloning, which has become increasingly accessible and realistic. The rest of the attack relies on standard credential harvesting and real-time interaction. The key TTP is the social engineering aspect of tricking a legitimate user into completing the authentication loop on the attacker's behalf.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe impact of a successful SilentVoice attack is severe. By gaining access to a legitimate, authenticated session, attackers bypass many traditional security controls. If they compromise a financial or ERP account, they can initiate fraudulent transactions, leading to direct financial loss. Access to a cloud administrator account could lead to a widespread data breach or infrastructure compromise. The success of these attacks undermines confidence in MFA as a panacea and demonstrates that even robust security postures can be defeated by targeting the human element. **[Proofpoint](https://www.proofpoint.com/)** has already linked this campaign to multiple successful breaches, confirming its real-world effectiveness.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\nDetection is challenging as the attack manipulates legitimate processes. Focus should be on anomalies and user-reported events.\n\n| Type | Value | Description | Context |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `log_source` | Authentication Logs | A successful MFA-authenticated login from an unfamiliar IP address, location, or device immediately following a report of a suspicious phone call. | SIEM, Cloud Provider Logs (e.g., Azure AD Sign-in Logs) |\n| `other` | User-reported suspicious phone call | An employee reporting a strange or urgent call from someone claiming to be an executive. This is the most likely early warning sign. | Help Desk ticketing system, Security team reporting channels |\n| `url_pattern` | Lookalike domains for corporate login portals | The credential harvesting site used in the first stage of the attack. | Web proxy logs, DNS logs |\n\n## Detection & Response\n-   **Impossible Travel Alerts:** Configure SIEM and identity management systems to generate 'impossible travel' alerts. An alert should be triggered if a user logs in from a new, distant location shortly after a login from their usual location. **D3FEND Technique:** [`User Geolocation Logon Pattern Analysis (D3-UGLPA)`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:UserGeolocationLogonPatternAnalysis).\n-   **MFA Authentication Analysis:** Analyze MFA approval logs. A pattern of a user denying a prompt and then quickly approving a second one, or approving a prompt from an unexpected location, could be suspicious. **D3FEND Technique:** [`Authentication Event Thresholding (D3-ANET)`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:AuthenticationEventThresholding).\n-   **User Reporting:** The most critical detection source is an aware user. Establish a clear, simple, and penalty-free process for employees to immediately report suspicious calls or interactions. Treat every report as a potential incident until verified otherwise.\n\n## Mitigation\n1.  **User Education:** This is the primary defense. Train employees, especially those in finance and IT, about the threat of AI-powered vishing. Create specific training modules that include examples of deepfake audio. Emphasize that they should never approve an MFA prompt they did not initiate themselves, regardless of who is asking or how urgent it seems. Institute a policy to verify unusual or urgent requests from executives through a separate, trusted communication channel (e.g., a direct call back to their known phone number or a message on a platform like Teams/Slack).\n2.  **Phishing-Resistant MFA:** Migrate from push-based MFA to more phishing-resistant methods like FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware security keys. These methods require the user to be physically present with the key and bind the authentication to the specific website, making it impossible for an attacker to relay the authentication from a fake site.\n3.  **Number Matching:** If using push-based MFA, enable 'number matching' or 'MFA code' features. This requires the user to type a number displayed on the login screen into their authenticator app, making it much harder for an attacker to trick them into blindly approving a prompt.\n4.  **Reduce Public Exposure:** While difficult, executives and key personnel should be mindful of their public digital footprint. Limiting the amount of high-quality audio available publicly can make it harder for attackers to train convincing voice models.","New 'SilentVoice' phishing campaign uses AI deepfake audio of executives to trick employees into approving MFA prompts.
