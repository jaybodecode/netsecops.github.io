The attackers maintained long-term access to F5's internal development environments, exfiltrating portions of the BIG-IP source code, information on undisclosed vulnerabilities, and some customer configuration data. While F5 states there is no evidence of software supply chain modification, the incident poses a significant future risk. In response, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued Emergency Directive 26-01, mandating all federal civilian agencies to immediately patch F5 products, inventory devices, and remove end-of-life systems from their networks.","## Executive Summary\nOn October 15, 2025, application delivery and security giant **[F5](https://www.f5.com/)** revealed it was the victim of a significant cyberattack by a sophisticated nation-state actor. The threat actor gained persistent access to F5's internal development and engineering environments, exfiltrating sensitive intellectual property. This includes portions of the source code for its flagship **BIG-IP** product and details of undisclosed vulnerabilities. The breach poses a severe potential threat, as the stolen information could grant the adversary a significant advantage in developing future exploits against F5 products globally. In a swift response to the 'imminent threat,' the U.S. **[Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov)** issued Emergency Directive 26-01, compelling federal agencies to take immediate remedial action.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe breach was first discovered on August 9, 2025, but the threat actor had maintained long-term access prior to this date. The attackers targeted F5's core development infrastructure, demonstrating a clear intent to gather intelligence for future offensive operations. Key exfiltrated data includes:\n-   Portions of the **BIG-IP source code**.\n-   Information on **undisclosed vulnerabilities** being tracked and fixed by F5's engineering teams.\n-   Configuration and implementation details for a small subset of customers.\n\nF5 has asserted that an independent investigation found no evidence that the attacker tampered with the software supply chain, including modifying source code or altering the build and release pipelines. Public disclosure of the incident was delayed at the request of the Department of Justice to support an ongoing national security investigation. The identity of the nation-state actor has not been disclosed.\n\n---\n\n## Technical Analysis\nWhile specific TTPs were not detailed in the disclosure, the nature of the attack suggests a sophisticated operation consistent with advanced persistent threats (APTs). The attack likely involved several phases:\n\n1.  **Initial Access**: The entry vector is unknown but could have included spear-phishing, exploitation of a public-facing application, or compromise of a developer's credentials.\n2.  **Persistence & Privilege Escalation**: The actor established long-term persistence within F5's network, likely using techniques like [`T1078 - Valid Accounts`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/) to blend in with normal activity.\n3.  **Discovery**: The attackers conducted extensive reconnaissance to locate high-value data within the development and engineering environments.\n4.  **Collection & Exfiltration**: The threat actor collected and exfiltrated sensitive data. The exfiltration of source code and vulnerability details points to an espionage motive, likely to support future exploit development. This aligns with [`T1195.002 - Compromise Software Supply Chain`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/002/) by acquiring information to enable future compromises.\n\n---\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe primary impact is the significant strategic advantage gained by the nation-state actor. With access to BIG-IP source code and unpatched vulnerability details, the attacker can:\n-   **Develop Zero-Day Exploits**: Create powerful exploits for vulnerabilities before patches are available.\n-   **Bypass Detections**: Analyze the source code to find ways to evade F5's security features and detection mechanisms.\n-   **Target F5 Customers**: Use the stolen customer configuration data to craft highly targeted attacks against specific organizations.\n\nFor U.S. federal agencies and global organizations relying on F5 products, this incident creates an 'imminent threat,' as stated by CISA. The stolen data dramatically increases the risk of future attacks against critical network infrastructure protected by BIG-IP devices.\n\n### CISA Emergency Directive 26-01\nCISA's directive mandates that Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies perform the following actions by October 22, 2025:\n-   Inventory all F5 BIG-IP products on their networks.\n-   Ensure no management interfaces are exposed to the public internet.\n-   Apply all newly released security patches from F5.\n-   Disconnect any end-of-life F5 devices.\n\n---\n\n## Detection & Response\nOrganizations using F5 products should act immediately:\n1.  **Follow CISA's Directive**: Even non-governmental organizations should adopt the CISA directive as a best practice. Inventory all F5 assets, apply the latest patches, and ensure management interfaces are not internet-accessible.\n2.  **Monitor F5 Devices**: Enhance monitoring of all F5 BIG-IP appliances. Look for anomalous administrative logins, unexpected configuration changes, or unusual outbound traffic. Use D3FEND technique [`D3-NTA: Network Traffic Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkTrafficAnalysis) to baseline normal traffic patterns and alert on deviations.\n3.  **Threat Hunting**: Proactively hunt for signs of compromise. Review historical logs for any suspicious activity originating from or targeting F5 devices, especially connections from unusual IP addresses or large data transfers.\n4.  **Credential Rotation**: Consider rotating all administrative credentials used to manage F5 devices as a precautionary measure.\n\n---\n\n## Mitigation\n1.  **Patch Management**: The most critical step is to apply the security updates released by F5 in response to this incident. Reference D3FEND countermeasure [`D3-SU: Software Update`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SoftwareUpdate).\n2.  **Network Segmentation**: Isolate F5 BIG-IP management interfaces on a dedicated, secure management network. Access should be restricted to authorized personnel via jump boxes or bastion hosts. This aligns with D3FEND's [`D3-NI: Network Isolation`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkIsolation).\n3.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enforce MFA for all administrative access to F5 devices and related management systems. This is a critical defense against credential compromise. Reference D3FEND's [`D3-MFA: Multi-factor Authentication`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:Multi-factorAuthentication).\n4.  **Third-Party Risk Management**: This incident highlights the importance of scrutinizing the security posture of critical vendors. Organizations should incorporate vendor security assessments into their risk management programs.","🚨 F5 discloses major breach by nation-state actor! BIG-IP source code & vuln data stolen.

The group listed the hospital on its darknet leak site on February 4, 2026, threatening to publish the data if a ransom was not paid. However, Epworth HealthCare conducted a thorough investigation with external cybersecurity experts and found \"no verified evidence of any impact to our systems or data.\" Cybersecurity researchers have corroborated this, assessing that 0APT is likely a \"fake\" ransomware operation. The group's modus operandi involves posting a high volume of victims without providing credible proof of a breach, instead using empty files or random data streams. This tactic relies on psychological pressure and the threat of reputational damage to extort payment, representing a shift from technical intrusion to pure intimidation.",[156,157,158,159,107,160,161],"0APT","Ransomware","Extortion","Bluff Attack","Australia","Cybercrime",[157,15,14],"2026-02-09T15:00:00.000Z","Created: Feb 9, 2026",false,{"id":167,"slug":168,"headline":169,"title":170,"severity":153,"article_type":100,"excerpt":171,"tags":172,"categories":176,"createdAt":163,"updatedAt":163,"displayDate":164,"isUpdated":165,"readingTime":178},"12ce5275-6395-4207-8b42-625544f7549f","killsec-ransomware-gang-targets-nigerian-startup-getly","KillSec Ransomware Group Claims Attack on Nigerian Tech Startup Getly","Nigerian Startup Getly Targeted by KillSec Ransomware Group","The ransomware group known as KillSec has claimed responsibility for a cyberattack on Getly, a Nigerian technology startup.
