Stryzhak, 35, was a key operator for the ransomware group that targeted high-revenue companies in the U.S. and Europe between 2018 and 2021, causing millions in damages. The group was known for its double-extortion tactics, stealing data before encryption and threatening to leak it on their 'Corporate Leaks' site. Stryzhak faces up to 10 years in prison, while his co-conspirator, Volodymyr Tymoshchuk, remains at large with an $11 million bounty offered by the U.S. Department of State.","## Executive Summary\nOn December 19, 2025, Artem Aleksandrovych Stryzhak, a 35-year-old Ukrainian national, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and extortion for his participation in the **[Nefilim](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/nefilim/)** ransomware operation. The plea took place in a Brooklyn federal court following his extradition from Spain. Stryzhak was a key member of the Nefilim group, which conducted a series of highly damaging ransomware attacks against large corporations primarily in the United States, Canada, and Australia from mid-2018 to late 2021. The group employed a double-extortion model, exfiltrating sensitive corporate data before encrypting victim networks and then threatening to publish the stolen data on a dedicated leak site to coerce payment. Stryzhak faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. His alleged co-conspirator, Volodymyr Tymoshchuk, remains a fugitive, with the **[U.S. Department of State](https://www.state.gov/)** offering a reward of up to $11 million for information leading to his capture.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\n- **Threat Actor:** **Nefilim** ransomware group.\n- **Key Individuals:** Artem Aleksandrovych Stryzhak (arrested operator), Volodymyr Tymoshchuk (fugitive administrator).\n- **Modus Operandi:** The group specialized in 'big game hunting,' specifically targeting companies with annual revenues exceeding $100 million. Their attacks followed a clear pattern:\n  1.  **Reconnaissance:** Researching target companies to assess financial value.\n  2.  **Initial Access:** Gaining entry to the network, often through exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications or using stolen credentials.\n  3.  **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing large volumes of sensitive corporate data.\n  4.  **Encryption:** Deploying customized ransomware executables to encrypt the victim's systems.\n  5.  **Extortion:** Demanding a ransom payment for the decryption key and threatening to publish the stolen data on their 'Corporate Leaks' dark web site if the victim refused to pay.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nWhile the court documents do not detail the full TTPs, the Nefilim group's activities are well-documented by security researchers. Their attack chain typically involved several MITRE ATT&CK techniques:\n\n1.  **Initial Access:** Nefilim often gained initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing devices, particularly VPNs and other remote services ([T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/)).\n2.  **Execution & Persistence:** Once inside, they used legitimate tools like **[PsExec](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0029)** and PowerShell for execution and lateral movement ([T1059.001 - PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059.001/)). They would establish persistence by creating new user accounts or scheduled tasks ([T1136 - Create Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136/)).\n3.  **Credential Access:** The group was known to use tools like **[Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002)** to dump credentials from memory to escalate privileges and move laterally ([T1003 - OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/)).\n4.  **Lateral Movement:** Using the stolen credentials, they moved across the network to identify high-value data and domain controllers ([T1021.002 - SMB/Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021.002/)).\n5.  **Exfiltration:** Before encryption, they would exfiltrate large amounts of data to attacker-controlled servers ([T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041/)).\n6.  **Impact:** Finally, they deployed the Nefilim ransomware payload across the network, encrypting files and leaving a ransom note ([T1486 - Data Encrypted for Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/)).\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe Nefilim group was responsible for millions of dollars in losses, stemming from ransom payments, operational downtime, and recovery costs. Their targeting of high-revenue companies meant that each successful attack could cause significant economic and reputational damage. The double-extortion tactic added a layer of pressure, as victims had to contend not only with operational disruption from encryption but also with the severe consequences of a public data breach, including regulatory fines and loss of customer trust.\n\n---\n\n## Detection & Response\n**D3FEND Reference:** [`D3-UBA: User Behavior Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:UserBehaviorAnalysis), [`D3-NTA: Network Traffic Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkTrafficAnalysis)\n\n1.  **Monitor for Legitimate Tools:** Nefilim's use of 'living-off-the-land' binaries (LOLBins) like `PsExec` and `PowerShell` for malicious purposes requires behavioral analysis. Monitor for `PsExec` being used to connect to multiple workstations from a non-admin source or PowerShell scripts executing encoded commands.\n2.  **Credential Dumping Detection:** Deploy EDR solutions that can detect and block memory-scraping activities characteristic of tools like Mimikatz.\n3.  **Network Egress Monitoring:** Monitor outbound network traffic for large, anomalous data transfers, especially to unknown or newly registered domains. This is a key indicator of data exfiltration preceding a ransomware attack.\n4.  **Active Directory Auditing:** Audit Active Directory for the creation of new administrative accounts or changes to group memberships, which are common persistence and privilege escalation techniques.\n\n## Mitigation\n**D3FEND Reference:** [`D3-SU: Software Update`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SoftwareUpdate), [`D3-MFA: Multi-factor Authentication`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:Multi-factorAuthentication), [`D3-NS: Network Segmentation`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkSegmentation)\n\n1.  **Patch Management:** The most effective way to prevent initial access is to maintain a rigorous patch management program, focusing on internet-facing systems like VPNs, RDP gateways, and web servers.\n2.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA on all remote access solutions (VPNs, RDP) and for all privileged accounts. This mitigates the risk of stolen credentials being used for initial access.\n3.  **Network Segmentation:** Segment the network to prevent attackers from moving laterally with ease. Critical assets, such as domain controllers and backup servers, should be in highly restricted network segments.\n4.  **Immutable Backups:** Maintain regular, offline, and immutable backups of critical data. A 3-2-1 backup strategy (3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite) is essential to recover from a ransomware attack without paying the ransom.\n5.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that user and service accounts only have the permissions necessary to perform their roles. This limits the impact of a compromised account.","⚖️ JUSTICE: Ukrainian operator of the Nefilim ransomware gang, Artem Stryzhak, pleads guilty in a US court.

Implement strict outbound traffic filtering rules on perimeter firewalls. By default, deny all outbound traffic from servers and workstations, and only allow connections to known, legitimate destinations on necessary ports (e.g., TCP/443 to trusted partner APIs or software update servers). This 'egress filtering' makes it significantly harder for attackers to exfiltrate stolen data. Combine this with network traffic analysis (NTA) to alert on any large data transfers leaving the network, especially from servers that do not typically send large amounts of data externally. This provides a critical window to detect and interrupt an attack between initial compromise and the final ransomware deployment.","M1037",{"technique_id":128,"technique_name":129,"url":130,"recommendation":131,"mitre_mitigation_id":132},"D3-BA","Backup and Recovery","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:BackupandRecovery","A robust backup and recovery strategy is the ultimate defense against the 'impact' phase of a ransomware attack.
