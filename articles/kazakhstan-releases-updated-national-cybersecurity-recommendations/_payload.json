This initiative aims to strengthen the country's digital defenses and comes as a recent study reveals that public awareness of cyber threats has surged to 86% in 2025, up from 62.9% in 2018. The new guidelines emphasize key practices like encryption and the use of antivirus software.","## Executive Summary\nThe government of Kazakhstan has taken a proactive step to bolster its national cybersecurity posture by releasing an updated set of recommendations for citizens and organizations. Published on December 23, 2025, by the **Ministry of Digital Development, Innovation and Aerospace Industry (MAIDD)**, the new guidelines focus on fundamental cyber hygiene and personal data protection. The release is timely, as a recent study highlighted a significant increase in public awareness of cyber threats, which rose to 86% in 2025. The nation's efforts are also reflected in its improved ranking in the Global Cybersecurity Index.\n\n---\n\n## Policy Overview\nThe MAIDD's updated recommendations are part of Kazakhstan's ongoing strategy to create a safer digital environment. The guidelines are not strict regulations but rather a set of best practices intended to promote better security habits among the populace. The key recommendations include:\n\n- **Use of Encryption**: Encouraging the use of encryption to protect data both in transit and at rest.\n- **Data Minimization**: Advising citizens to limit the amount of personal information they share publicly online.\n- **Antivirus Protection**: Stressing the necessity of installing and maintaining updated antivirus software on all devices.\n\nThis public awareness campaign is supported by a government-provided mechanism for reporting security incidents. Citizens can report cases of illegal data collection or data leakage through the e-Government portal or directly to the Information Security Committee (ISC).\n\n---\n\n## Rising Awareness and National Standing\nThe government's focus on cybersecurity appears to be resonating with the public. A recent study cited in the announcement shows that citizen awareness of cyber threats has jumped from 62.9% in 2018 to 86% in 2025. This increased awareness is a critical component of national cyber defense, as informed citizens are the first line of defense against threats like phishing and scams.\n\nThese national efforts have also been recognized internationally. Kazakhstan has improved its position in the International Telecommunication Union's (ITU) Global Cybersecurity Index, now placing in the \"Advancing\" tier with a high score of 94.4 out of 100. This indicates a strong commitment to developing and implementing effective cybersecurity policies and capabilities.\n\n---\n\n## Impact and Guidance\nFor citizens and businesses in Kazakhstan, these recommendations serve as a clear and actionable guide to improving their digital security. Adhering to these guidelines can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to common cyberattacks. The establishment of a formal reporting channel empowers individuals to take action when they suspect their data has been mishandled, fostering a culture of accountability.\n\nFor the government, this initiative represents a soft-power approach to cybersecurity, focusing on education and empowerment rather than solely on punitive regulation. By raising the overall level of cyber hygiene across the country, Kazakhstan aims to make itself a harder target for cybercriminals and other malicious actors.","Kazakhstan releases updated national cybersecurity recommendations as public threat awareness soars to 86%.
