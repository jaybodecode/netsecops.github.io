The attack, which was posted to the group's leak site on October 23, 2025, follows the common double-extortion model, where the attackers threaten to publish sensitive stolen data if their ransom demands are not met. The incident highlights the continued targeting of the education sector by ransomware gangs, who view them as valuable targets due to the sensitive student and staff data they hold.","## Executive Summary\nThe **Tengu** ransomware group has publicly claimed a successful cyberattack against **UniCursos**, a Brazilian educational institution specializing in preparatory courses. On October 23, 2025, the group added UniCursos to its dark web leak site, threatening to release sensitive data if a ransom is not paid. This incident is another example of the 'double extortion' tactic favored by modern ransomware gangs, where they both encrypt a victim's files and exfiltrate data for additional leverage. The education sector remains a prime target for such attacks due to its often limited cybersecurity resources and the large amounts of personally identifiable information (PII) it manages.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\n- **Threat Actor:** Tengu, a ransomware group.\n- **Victim:** UniCursos, an education provider in São Paulo, Brazil.\n- **Date of Claim:** October 23, 2025.\n- **Attack Type:** Ransomware with double extortion. The attackers have encrypted the victim's systems and exfiltrated data, which they are threatening to leak.\n\nThis attack fits a common pattern where ransomware groups target small to medium-sized organizations that are perceived as having weaker defenses and a high incentive to pay to restore operations and prevent data leakage. The education sector is particularly vulnerable, holding sensitive data on students (including minors) and staff.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nWhile no specific technical details of the attack on UniCursos have been released, ransomware attacks typically follow a standard lifecycle:\n1.  **Initial Access:** Often achieved through phishing emails, exploitation of unpatched public-facing vulnerabilities (e.g., in VPNs or RDP), or stolen credentials purchased on the dark web.\n2.  **Reconnaissance and Lateral Movement:** Once inside, the attackers map the network, identify critical assets like domain controllers and file servers, and escalate privileges, often to domain administrator.\n3.  **Data Exfiltration:** Before encryption, the attackers steal large quantities of sensitive data and transfer it to their own servers.\n4.  **Impact:** The ransomware payload is deployed across the network, encrypting files on servers and workstations. A ransom note is left behind with instructions for payment.\n\n## Impact Assessment\n- **Operational Disruption:** UniCursos likely faces significant disruption to its administrative and educational services.\n- **Data Breach:** The potential leak of student and staff data, including names, contact details, and possibly financial information, poses a serious privacy risk.\n- **Reputational Damage:** The attack can damage the institution's reputation and trust among current and prospective students.\n- **Financial Costs:** Costs will be incurred from the incident response, potential ransom payment, regulatory fines, and legal fees.\n\n## IOCs\nNo specific Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) have been publicly released.\n\n## Detection & Response\n- **Endpoint Monitoring:** Deploy EDR solutions to detect common ransomware behaviors, such as rapid file modification/encryption, deletion of volume shadow copies (`vssadmin`), and the creation of ransom note files. This aligns with D3FEND's [`File Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:FileAnalysis).\n- **Network Monitoring:** Monitor for large, unexpected data transfers leaving the network, which could indicate data exfiltration prior to encryption.\n- **Dark Web Monitoring:** Proactive monitoring of ransomware leak sites can provide early warning that your organization's data has been stolen, even before the encryption phase begins.\n\n## Mitigation\n- **Backup and Recovery:** Maintain a robust backup strategy following the 3-2-1 rule (3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite and immutable/air-gapped). Regularly test your ability to restore from backups.\n- **Network Segmentation:** Segment the network to prevent ransomware from spreading from workstations to critical servers.\n- **Vulnerability Management:** Regularly patch all systems and software, especially public-facing applications and devices.\n- **User Training:** Train employees to recognize and report phishing emails, a common entry vector for ransomware.","Tengu ransomware group claims attack on UniCursos, a Brazilian education provider.

Configure these tools to detect and alert on common ransomware behaviors. Key indicators include: a process rapidly reading, modifying, and renaming a large number of files; the creation of files with known ransomware extensions; or the appearance of files named 'ransom.txt' or similar in multiple directories. Another powerful technique is the use of 'honeypot' files or canary files. These are decoy documents placed on file shares. Any modification to these files should trigger a high-priority alert and an automated response, such as isolating the affected host from the network, to stop the encryption process before it spreads.","M1021",{"technique_id":86,"technique_name":87,"url":88,"recommendation":89,"mitre_mitigation_id":90},"D3-OTF","Outbound Traffic Filtering","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:OutboundTrafficFiltering","To combat the 'double extortion' tactic used by Tengu, where data is stolen before encryption, organizations must implement strict outbound traffic filtering and monitoring. Configure network firewalls to block all outbound traffic by default and only allow connections to known-good destinations on standard ports. Deploy a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solution to inspect allowed outbound traffic for sensitive data patterns (e.g., student ID numbers, PII). A large, unexpected data transfer from a file server to an unknown external IP address is a major indicator of pre-ransomware data exfiltration. Detecting and blocking this transfer can turn a devastating double-extortion attack into a more manageable encryption-only incident.","M1037",[],[93,98,103],{"type":94,"value":95,"description":96,"context":97,"confidence":16},"file_name","ransom.txt","Creation of files with common ransom note names across multiple directories is a strong indicator of a ransomware attack in progress.","File Integrity Monitoring (FIM), EDR alerts",{"type":99,"value":100,"description":101,"context":102,"confidence":16},"command_line_pattern","wevtutil.exe cl","Attackers often use the Windows Event Utility (wevtutil.exe) to clear security, system, and application logs to cover their tracks before or during ransomware deployment.","EDR logs, command-line logging",{"type":104,"value":105,"description":106,"context":107,"confidence":108},"process_name","Raccine.exe","While not an indicator of compromise, the presence and execution of ransomware 'vaccine' tools like Raccine can indicate an organization is attempting to mitigate ransomware by killing processes that trigger common ransomware behaviors.","EDR process monitoring","low",[110,111,112,113],"Tengu Ransomware","Brazil","Education Sector","Double Extortion","2025-10-24T15:00:00.000Z","NewsArticle",{"geographic_scope":117,"companies_affected":118,"countries_affected":119,"industries_affected":120},"national",[22],[111],[121],"Education",4,{"articles":124,"totalCount":3170,"lastUpdated":3171},[125,144,163,181,199,216,230,248,265,285,297,313,324,339,352,366,380,395,406,415,428,443,457,471,483,495,508,522,534,547,560,574,583,599,615,626,636,648,665,677,690,701,713,724,737,749,762,774,786,797,808,817,829,843,854,864,877,886,896,907,923,935,944,958,969,985,999,1011,1024,1036,1049,1064,1077,1087,1101,1111,1123,1136,1150,1162,1172,1185,1195,1206,1218,1231,1250,1260,1270,1281,1295,1309,1321,1334,1344,1356,1368,1380,1395,1407,1420,1433,1443,1455,1468,1482,1492,1504,1516,1529,1543,1555,1565,1576,1590,1601,1611,1624,1633,1645,1659,1669,1682,1691,1704,1715,1726,1738,1747,1758,1770,1784,1797,1808,1823,1835,1845,1848,1858,1867,1877,1892,1904,1917,1927,1938,1949,1960,1972,1982,1995,2006,2021,2033,2047,2060,2072,2081,2093,2105,2118,2127,2138,2149,2161,2172,2183,2197,2208,2220,2231,2244,2255,2269,2281,2293,2304,2315,2325,2335,2346,2357,2367,2379,2391,2405,2414,2427,2438,2449,2458,2468,2479,2489,2500,2512,2524,2534,2544,2556,2566,2580,2592,2602,2612,2621,2632,2642,2652,2665,2675,2685,2698,2708,2721,2732,2744,2756,2768,2778,2789,2801,2811,2822,2832,2842,2852,2862,2872,2884,2898,2908,2921,2932,2943,2952,2963,2973,2982,2991,3000,3011,3020,3031,3041,3052,3060,3069,3079,3089,3100,3111,3121,3132,3140,3149,3159],{"id":126,"slug":127,"headline":128,"title":129,"severity":16,"article_type":115,"excerpt":130,"tags":131,"categories":138,"createdAt":141,"updatedAt":141,"displayDate":142,"isUpdated":143,"readingTime":122},"14b72146-a348-4383-83a8-3f04b0ca0c2d","checkout-com-breached-by-shinyhunters-rejects-ransom","Checkout.com Rejects Ransom After ShinyHunters Breach, Donates to Research","Payment Processor Checkout.com Breached by ShinyHunters via Legacy Cloud Storage; Refuses Ransom and Donates to Cybersecurity Research","The global payment processor Checkout.com has disclosed a data breach orchestrated by the ShinyHunters cybercrime group.
