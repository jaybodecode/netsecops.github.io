The flaw allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system. In response to observed attacks, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog and issued an emergency directive mandating federal agencies apply patches within an accelerated seven-day window, by November 25, 2025. Researchers have detected approximately 2,000 attacks leveraging the flaw and warn it could potentially be chained with a recently disclosed authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2025-64446) to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution.","## Executive Summary\nOn November 19, 2025, **[Fortinet](https://www.fortinet.com/)** disclosed **CVE-2025-58034**, a critical OS command injection vulnerability in its FortiWeb Web Application Firewall (WAF) product line. The zero-day flaw is being actively exploited in the wild, allowing authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web server process. The **[U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov)** has added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog and issued an emergency directive with an aggressive seven-day patching deadline for federal agencies, highlighting the significant risk it poses. Security researchers have already observed around 2,000 exploitation attempts. There is a high risk that this vulnerability could be chained with other flaws, such as the recent authentication bypass **CVE-2025-64446**, to enable unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) attacks against internet-facing devices.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n**CVE-2025-58034** is an OS command injection vulnerability affecting FortiWeb WAFs. An attacker with valid credentials for the device's management interface can execute arbitrary operating system commands by sending specially crafted HTTP requests or using CLI commands. The root cause lies in insufficient input sanitization within the management interface, allowing command-chaining characters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `&&`) to be passed to the underlying shell.\n\n- **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-58034\n- **Vulnerability Type:** OS Command Injection (CWE-78)\n- **Attack Vector:** Network\n- **Complexity:** Low (for an authenticated attacker)\n- **Privileges Required:** High (Valid administrator credentials)\n- **User Interaction:** None\n\n## Affected Systems\n**[Fortinet](https://www.fortinet.com/)** has confirmed the vulnerability affects its FortiWeb product line. While specific version numbers were not detailed in the initial reports, organizations using any version of FortiWeb should assume they are vulnerable and consult Fortinet's security advisory for patched versions. The flaw impacts all form factors, including hardware appliances, virtual machines, and cloud-based instances.\n\n## Exploitation Status\nBoth **[Fortinet](https://www.fortinet.com/)** and **[CISA](https://www.cisa.gov)** have confirmed that **CVE-2025-58034** is being actively exploited in the wild. Security vendor **[Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/)**, credited with the discovery, reported approximately 2,000 detections of exploitation attempts. The primary concern is the potential for this vulnerability to be chained with **CVE-2025-64446**, a recently disclosed authentication bypass in the same product. If chained, an unauthenticated attacker could gain full control over a vulnerable FortiWeb appliance, a highly attractive target for threat actors seeking to compromise network traffic or pivot into protected networks.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nA successful exploit of **CVE-2025-58034** allows an attacker to gain full control over the FortiWeb appliance. This can lead to several severe consequences:\n- **Traffic Interception and Manipulation:** As a WAF, the appliance inspects traffic to and from web applications. A compromised WAF could be used to bypass security rules, inject malicious content into legitimate traffic, or steal sensitive data like session cookies and credentials.\n- **Network Pivot Point:** The compromised appliance can serve as a beachhead for attackers to launch further attacks against the internal network that the WAF is designed to protect.\n- **Denial of Service:** An attacker could disable the WAF, leaving backend applications exposed to attack, or disrupt its operation, causing an outage for critical services.\n- **Reputational Damage:** A breach originating from a security appliance undermines trust in the organization's security posture.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\nSecurity teams should hunt for signs of exploitation attempts targeting FortiWeb appliances. These are not confirmed IOCs but expert-generated indicators for hunting.\n\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `url_pattern` | `*/api/v2.0/system/maintenance/firmware` | A common endpoint for system commands that could be abused. |\n| `command_line_pattern` | `uname -a; id; ls -la` | Attackers often run basic reconnaissance commands post-exploitation. Look for these in shell logs on the appliance. |\n| `log_source` | `FortiWeb Event Logs` | Monitor for anomalous administrator logins, especially from unusual IP addresses, followed by configuration changes or system commands. |\n| `network_traffic_pattern` | `Outbound connections from FortiWeb management IP` | Watch for unexpected outbound connections (e.g., to Pastebin, GitHub, or unknown IPs) from the appliance's management interface, which could indicate a reverse shell or data exfiltration. |\n\n## Detection & Response\n- **Log Analysis:** Review FortiWeb logs for any unauthorized or suspicious administrative access, particularly around November 19, 2025. Scrutinize all commands executed via the web UI or CLI for suspicious patterns, such as shell metacharacters (`;`, `|`, `&&`, `$(...)`).\n- **Network Monitoring:** Implement network traffic analysis ([D3-NTA](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkTrafficAnalysis)) to monitor for unusual outbound connections originating from the FortiWeb appliance's management interface. A WAF should typically not initiate connections to arbitrary external hosts.\n- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** If possible, ensure monitoring agents are active on the underlying OS of virtual FortiWeb appliances to detect suspicious process execution, such as `sh`, `bash`, or `curl` being spawned by the web server process.\n- **Threat Hunting:** Proactively hunt for evidence of command injection in web server logs on the FortiWeb appliance. Search for requests containing reconnaissance commands like `whoami`, `id`, `uname`, or network enumeration tools like `netstat`.\n\n## Mitigation\n- **Immediate Patching:** The primary mitigation is to apply the security patches released by **[Fortinet](https://www.fortinet.com/)** immediately. Given the active exploitation and CISA's emergency directive, this should be treated as the highest priority. This aligns with MITRE's [`M1051 - Update Software`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1051/) mitigation.\n- **Restrict Access:** As a compensating control, restrict access to the FortiWeb management interface to a limited set of trusted IP addresses and dedicated management networks. This is a key principle of [`M1035 - Limit Access to Resource Over Network`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1035/).\n- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA on all administrative accounts to mitigate the risk of credential compromise, which is a prerequisite for exploiting this authenticated vulnerability. This corresponds to [`M1032 - Multi-factor Authentication`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1032/).\n- **Web Application Firewall (WAF) for the WAF:** If possible, place another inspection device in front of the FortiWeb's management interface to monitor for malicious requests, although this is often not practical.","🚨 URGENT: CISA orders federal agencies to patch a critical, actively exploited Fortinet FortiWeb zero-day (CVE-2025-58034) within 7 days.
