The flaw is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in the ZCS Classic Web Client that can be triggered with no user interaction beyond viewing a malicious email. An attacker can craft a malicious iCalendar invitation that, when processed, executes arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's authenticated session. This allows for account takeover, data exfiltration, and redirection of sensitive emails. Federal agencies are mandated to apply mitigations by October 28, 2025.","## Executive Summary\nThe U.S. **[Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov)** has added a new zero-day vulnerability, **`CVE-2025-27915`**, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog on October 7, 2025. This action confirms that the flaw is being actively exploited in the wild. The vulnerability is a high-severity (CVSS 7.5) stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue affecting the Classic Web Client of **[Synacor](https://www.synacor.com/)'s** **[Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS)](https://www.zimbra.com/)**. Exploitation requires no user interaction other than the victim's mail client opening or viewing a specially crafted email containing a malicious calendar invite. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's session, leading to account compromise. Federal agencies must apply mitigations by October 28, 2025.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n**`CVE-2025-27915`** is a stored XSS vulnerability that arises from insufficient sanitization of HTML content within iCalendar (`.ics`) files. The ZCS Classic Web Client fails to properly neutralize malicious code embedded in calendar invitations.\n\n### Technical Description\nAn attacker can craft a malicious `.ics` calendar appointment containing a `\u003Cdetails>` HTML tag with an `ontoggle` JavaScript event handler. This malicious appointment is then emailed to a target. When the victim's Zimbra web client renders or previews the email, the `ontoggle` event is triggered automatically, executing the embedded JavaScript payload. This occurs without the user needing to click any links or explicitly accept the invitation.\n\nOnce the script executes, the attacker has control over the victim's authenticated web session, enabling them to perform any action the user can.\n\n## Affected Systems\n*   **Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS)** versions 9.0, 10.0, and 10.1\n*   Specifically, the **Classic Web Client** is affected.\n\n## Exploitation Status\nThe vulnerability is a zero-day and is confirmed by CISA to be under active exploitation. The low complexity and lack of required user interaction make it a potent tool for attackers targeting organizations that use Zimbra for their email services, which often includes government and educational institutions.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nSuccessful exploitation of **`CVE-2025-27915`** can lead to a full compromise of a user's email account. The impact includes:\n*   **Data Exfiltration**: Attackers can read, forward, and steal all emails from the compromised account, including sensitive corporate data and personal information. ([`T1114.001 - Local Email Collection`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/001/))\n*   **Session Hijacking**: The attacker can use the active session to impersonate the user, send emails on their behalf, and access other integrated applications.\n*   **Persistence and Lateral Movement**: Attackers can create malicious email forwarding rules to continuously exfiltrate new incoming emails to an external address. They can also use the compromised account to launch further phishing attacks against other employees. ([`T1114.003 - Email Forwarding Rule`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/003/))\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\nDetection should focus on identifying malicious `.ics` files and subsequent anomalous account activity.\n\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `string_pattern` | `\u003Cdetails ontoggle=` | Scan incoming emails and `.ics` attachments for the presence of this specific HTML tag and event handler combination. This is a strong indicator of an exploitation attempt. |\n| `log_source` | Zimbra Mail Logs | Monitor for the creation of new or modified email filtering/forwarding rules, especially those directing mail to external domains. |\n| `network_traffic_pattern` | Outbound connections from Zimbra web client | Analyze network traffic from user endpoints to detect the compromised web session communicating with an attacker-controlled server. |\n| `file_name` | `invitation.ics` | While generic, be extra vigilant with emails containing iCalendar attachments, and apply content scanning. |\n\n## Detection Methods\n1.  **Email Gateway Scanning**: Configure email security gateways to scan the content of `.ics` attachments for malicious HTML tags like `\u003Cdetails>` and `ontoggle`. Use D3FEND's [`File Content Rules`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:FileContentRules) to block these threats.\n2.  **Audit Log Review**: Regularly audit Zimbra audit logs for suspicious activities, such as unexpected changes to account settings, new filter creation, or logins from unusual IP addresses immediately following the receipt of a calendar invite.\n3.  **WAF Rules**: If possible, implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) rule to inspect and sanitize content rendered by the Zimbra web client, although this can be complex.\n\n## Remediation Steps\nAs this is an actively exploited zero-day, immediate action is required.\n\n1.  **Apply Mitigations**: Zimbra has not yet released a full patch, but has provided mitigation guidance. This typically involves manually sanitizing the input or disabling the vulnerable component. Federal agencies are required to apply these vendor-supplied mitigations by October 28, 2025. This is a form of D3FEND [`Application Configuration Hardening`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ApplicationConfigurationHardening).\n2.  **Switch to Modern Web Client**: If feasible, advise users to switch from the 'Classic Web Client' to the 'Modern Web Client', which is not affected by this specific vulnerability.\n3.  **Review Accounts for Compromise**: Administratively review all user accounts for unauthorized forwarding rules, delegated permissions, or other signs of compromise.","ðŸ“¢ CISA KEV ALERT: A zero-day XSS flaw (CVE-2025-27915) in Zimbra Collaboration Suite is being actively exploited.
