According to CERT-UA, the attacks, which occurred between October and December 2025, use a novel malware strain called PluggyApe. The campaign employs sophisticated social engineering, with attackers making direct contact with targets on secure messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp, using charity-themed lures to build trust and deliver the malware.","## Executive Summary\nUkraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (**CERT-UA**) has issued an alert regarding a targeted cyber-espionage campaign against the **Ukrainian Defense Forces**. The campaign, attributed to the Kremlin-linked threat group **Void Blizzard** (also known as Laundry Bear and tracked by Ukraine as UAC-0190), was active between October and December 2025. The attackers have shifted tactics from mass phishing to highly personalized social engineering, directly contacting military personnel on encrypted messaging apps like **Signal** and **WhatsApp**. Posing as representatives of charitable foundations, the attackers lure targets into downloading a new malware backdoor named **PluggyApe**. This malware provides persistent remote access to the victim's machine, enabling data exfiltration and further command execution, directly supporting Russian intelligence-gathering efforts in the ongoing conflict.\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe campaign demonstrates a significant evolution in social engineering tradecraft. Void Blizzard operators are no longer relying on impersonal, large-scale email campaigns. Instead, they are:\n-   **Making Direct Contact:** Using secure messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp to initiate conversations.\n-   **Building Trust:** Leveraging compromised accounts, Ukrainian phone numbers, and speaking fluent Ukrainian. They engage in detailed conversations, sometimes including audio or video calls, to establish credibility.\n-   **Using Themed Lures:** Impersonating legitimate charitable foundations supporting the Ukrainian military, a theme designed to resonate strongly with their targets.\n\nOnce trust is established, the attacker directs the target to a fake charity website to download a document, which is actually the PluggyApe malware disguised with an icon like a `.docx` file (e.g., as a `.docx.pif` file), often delivered within a password-protected archive to evade initial security scans ([`T1566.001`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/)).\n\n## Technical Analysis\n**PluggyApe** is a backdoor built using **PyInstaller**, which bundles a Python script into a standalone executable. Its primary functions include:\n-   **Persistence:** It establishes persistence on the infected system by creating or modifying Windows Registry keys, typically in the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run` path, ensuring it runs every time the user logs in ([`T1547.001`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/)).\n-   **Data Exfiltration:** Upon execution, it gathers system information (e.g., hostname, username, OS version) and exfiltrates it to a command-and-control (C2) server.\n-   **Remote Access:** It acts as a backdoor, allowing the attacker to send further commands to the compromised machine, such as downloading additional payloads or searching for and exfiltrating specific files.\n\nAn updated version observed in December 2025 showed improved obfuscation and a more dynamic C2 mechanism, using services like **Pastebin** to fetch the C2 server address, making it harder for defenders to block.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThis campaign poses a direct threat to Ukraine's national security. By compromising the devices of military personnel, Void Blizzard can:\n-   Steal sensitive military intelligence, such as troop movements, operational plans, and personnel information.\n-   Gain insight into military communications and strategies.\n-   Use the compromised devices as a pivot point to attack broader military networks.\n-   Conduct psychological operations by spreading disinformation through compromised accounts.\n\nThe highly targeted and personal nature of the social engineering makes this campaign particularly dangerous and difficult to defend against with technology alone.\n\n## Detection & Response\n-   **Endpoint Detection:** EDR solutions should be configured to alert on the creation of `.pif` files or executables with double extensions. Monitor for processes making modifications to the `CurrentVersion\\Run` registry key. This aligns with [`D3-SFA: System File Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SystemFileAnalysis).\n-   **Network Monitoring:** Block or alert on outbound connections to text-sharing sites like Pastebin from processes other than web browsers. This could indicate a malware variant like PluggyApe attempting to fetch its C2 address.\n-   **User Training:** This is the most critical defense. Military personnel must be trained to be extremely skeptical of unsolicited contact, even on secure messaging apps and from apparently friendly sources. All requests to download files or visit websites from unknown contacts should be treated as suspicious.\n\n## Mitigation\n1.  **Execution Prevention:** Configure systems to block the execution of files from untrusted sources or with suspicious extensions like `.pif`. Use application control solutions to allowlist known-good applications, preventing unknown malware like PluggyApe from running. This is a direct application of [`D3-EAL: Executable Allowlisting`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ExecutableAllowlisting).\n2.  **Verify, Then Trust:** Instruct personnel to never download files or click links from unsolicited contacts without independent verification of the sender's identity through an official channel.\n3.  **Disable Scripting:** Where possible, disable scripting environments like PowerShell for standard users to prevent the execution of malicious scripts downloaded by a first-stage payload.\n4.  **Limit Local Admin Rights:** Ensure that military personnel do not use accounts with local administrator privileges for daily tasks. This can limit a malware's ability to establish persistence and access sensitive system files.","Kremlin-linked hackers (Void Blizzard) are targeting Ukraine's military with new 'PluggyApe' malware. 🇺🇦 The campaign uses charity-themed lures and direct contact on Signal/WhatsApp to build trust. #Ukraine #Malware #CyberWarfare","Russian-linked threat group Void Blizzard (UAC-0190) is targeting the Ukrainian Defense Forces with a new malware called PluggyApe, using sophisticated social engineering and charity-themed lures.",[13,14,15],"Threat Actor","Malware","Cyberattack","high",[18,21,23,25,28,30,33,35,37],{"name":19,"type":20},"Void Blizzard","threat_actor",{"name":22,"type":20},"Laundry Bear",{"name":24,"type":20},"UAC-0190",{"name":26,"type":27},"CERT-UA","government_agency",{"name":29,"type":27},"Ukrainian Defense Forces",{"name":31,"type":32},"Signal","product",{"name":34,"type":32},"WhatsApp",{"name":36,"type":32},"PyInstaller",{"name":38,"type":32},"Pastebin",[],[41,47,52,58],{"url":42,"title":43,"date":44,"friendly_name":45,"website":46},"https://therecord.media/kremlin-linked-hackers-charities-ukraine-military","Kremlin-linked hackers pose as charities to spy on Ukraine's military","2026-01-13","The Record","therecord.media",{"url":48,"title":49,"date":44,"friendly_name":50,"website":51},"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraines-army-targeted-in-new-charity-themed-malware-campaign/","Ukraine's army targeted in new charity-themed malware campaign","BleepingComputer","bleepingcomputer.com",{"url":53,"title":54,"date":55,"friendly_name":56,"website":57},"https://the420.in/2026/01/14/ukraines-army-targeted-in-charity-themed-malware-campaign-russian-cyber-group-suspected/","Ukraine’s Army Targeted in ‘Charity’-Themed Malware Campaign; Russian Cyber Group Suspected","2026-01-14","The 420","the420.in",{"url":59,"title":60,"date":61,"friendly_name":62,"website":63},"https://risky.biz/bulletin522/","Risky Bulletin: Voice cloning defenses still weak, can be bypassed","2026-01-12","Risky Business","risky.biz",[65,68,71],{"datetime":66,"summary":67},"2025-10-01T00:00:00Z","The start of the observed PluggyApe campaign against the Ukrainian Defense Forces.",{"datetime":69,"summary":70},"2025-12-31T23:59:59Z","The end of the observed campaign period, with an updated version of PluggyApe noted in December.",{"datetime":72,"summary":73},"2026-01-13T00:00:00Z","CERT-UA and security media report on the Void Blizzard campaign.",[75,79,83,87],{"id":76,"name":77,"tactic":78},"T1566.001","Spearphishing Attachment","Initial Access",{"id":80,"name":81,"tactic":82},"T1588.002","Tool","Resource Development",{"id":84,"name":85,"tactic":86},"T1547.001","Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder","Persistence",{"id":88,"name":89,"tactic":90},"T1105","Ingress Tool Transfer","Command and Control",[92,97,106],{"id":93,"name":94,"description":95,"domain":96},"M1017","User Training","Training military personnel to be skeptical of unsolicited contact and verify identities is the primary defense against this social engineering-heavy campaign.","enterprise",{"id":98,"name":99,"d3fend_techniques":100,"description":105,"domain":96},"M1038","Execution Prevention",[101],{"id":102,"name":103,"url":104},"D3-EAL","Executable Allowlisting","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ExecutableAllowlisting","Using application allowlisting to prevent the execution of unknown executables like PluggyApe is a powerful technical control.",{"id":107,"name":108,"d3fend_techniques":109,"description":114,"domain":96},"M1049","Antivirus/Antimalware",[110],{"id":111,"name":112,"url":113},"D3-FH","File Hashing","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:FileHashing","While attackers use packers like PyInstaller to evade signatures, up-to-date AV/AM solutions may detect the malware based on heuristics or updated signatures.",[116,118],{"technique_id":102,"technique_name":103,"url":104,"recommendation":117,"mitre_mitigation_id":98},"Given that the PluggyApe campaign relies on tricking a user into running a novel executable, Executable Allowlisting is a highly effective, albeit stringent, countermeasure.
