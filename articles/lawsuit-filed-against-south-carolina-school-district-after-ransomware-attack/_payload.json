The lawsuit alleges that the school district was negligent in protecting sensitive data and violated state law by failing to provide timely and complete notification of the breach. The compromised data included names, birthdates, Social Security numbers, and financial files, making it one of the most significant breaches for an educational institution in the region.","## Executive Summary\nA class-action lawsuit has been filed against Lexington-Richland School District 5 (LR5) in South Carolina, stemming from a ransomware attack that occurred in June 2025. The attack resulted in a data breach that exposed the sensitive personal information of more than 31,000 individuals, including students, parents, and staff. The lawsuit accuses the district of negligence in its cybersecurity practices and of violating South Carolina's Data Breach Notification Laws. The plaintiffs claim the district's notification to affected families was both delayed and insufficient, leaving them vulnerable. The suit seeks monetary damages and court-mandated improvements to the district's data security.\n\n---\n\n## Regulatory Details\nThe lawsuit centers on alleged negligence and violations of the **South Carolina Data Breach Notification Law (S.C. Code § 39-1-90)**. This law requires organizations to notify affected state residents of a breach of personal information 'in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay.' The lawsuit contends that LR5's notification efforts did not meet this standard.\n\n### Incident Timeline\n- **June 3, 2025:** The school district first confirmed 'unusual network activity.'\n- **Post-June 2025:** A forensic investigation revealed that external threat actors had gained access to servers and exfiltrated data.\n- **October 2025:** A class-action lawsuit is filed against the district.\n\n## Affected Organizations\n- **Primary:** Lexington-Richland School District 5 (LR5), South Carolina.\n- **Affected Population:** Over 31,000 students (current and former), parents, and staff members.\n\n## Compliance Requirements\nThe lawsuit highlights several key compliance and security obligations for organizations handling sensitive data, particularly in the education sector:\n- **Duty of Care:** Organizations have a common law duty to exercise reasonable care in protecting the PII they collect and store.\n- **Timely Notification:** Adherence to state data breach notification laws, which mandate prompt and clear communication to affected individuals.\n- **Adequate Security Measures:** Implementing reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect against foreseeable threats. This includes measures like data encryption, access controls, and regular security assessments.\n\n## Impact Assessment\n- **For Affected Individuals:** The 31,000+ individuals are at an increased risk of identity theft, fraud, and phishing due to the exposure of their names, birthdates, and Social Security numbers.\n- **For the School District:** LR5 faces significant legal and financial repercussions. This includes the cost of litigation, potential monetary damages awarded to the plaintiffs, regulatory fines, and reputational damage within the community. The lawsuit also demands that the district fund more robust credit monitoring services and improve its security posture, which will require substantial investment.\n\n## Enforcement & Penalties\nUnder South Carolina law, while the Attorney General can bring an action and seek fines, this class-action lawsuit represents a civil action brought by the victims themselves. If successful, the court could award actual damages to the plaintiffs. The primary 'penalty' sought is financial compensation for the harm caused by the data exposure and the cost of mitigating future identity theft risks. The suit also seeks injunctive relief, forcing the district to implement better security practices.\n\n## Compliance Guidance\nThis incident serves as a critical lesson for all organizations, especially in the public and education sectors:\n1.  **Know Your Data:** Maintain a clear inventory of the sensitive data you hold, where it is stored, and who has access to it.\n2.  **Implement Foundational Controls:** Enforce security fundamentals like the principle of least privilege, network segmentation, robust vulnerability management, and multi-factor authentication.\n3.  **Plan for the Worst:** Develop and regularly test an incident response plan. This plan must include a clear, pre-vetted communications strategy that complies with all relevant state breach notification laws.\n4.  **Engage Legal Counsel Early:** In the event of a suspected breach, engage legal counsel immediately to ensure all actions and communications are handled correctly under legal privilege and in compliance with regulations.","A SC school district is facing a class-action lawsuit after a ransomware attack exposed data of 31,000+ students & staff.

The plan should pre-define roles and responsibilities, include pre-drafted notification templates, and establish clear triggers for when to engage external legal counsel and forensic investigators.

For LR5, this would mean using tools to automatically find where all SSNs, birthdates, and other PII are stored, whether on servers, endpoints, or in the cloud. Once found, the system should assess the security posture of that data—is it encrypted? Who has access? Are there excessive permissions? By proactively identifying and remediating these risks, the district could have either prevented the breach or demonstrated to the court that it had taken reasonable steps to protect its data.","M1047",[],[],[13,14,93,94,95],"Education Sector","Lawsuit","PII","2025-10-24T15:00:00.000Z","NewsArticle",{"geographic_scope":99,"countries_affected":100,"industries_affected":102,"other_affected":104,"people_affected_estimate":106},"local",[101],"United States",[103],"Education",[105],"Lexington-Richland School District 5","over 31,000",4,{"articles":109,"totalCount":7371,"lastUpdated":7372},[110,129,149,168,183,196,210,229,245,258,276,288,301,315,328,341,356,367,381,395,410,424,441,456,469,481,494,508,523,534,549,563,575,590,604,616,630,643,655,667,679,694,704,722,732,744,754,768,781,793,801,813,827,838,850,859,876,890,901,913,926,941,950,964,975,988,1000,1012,1024,1038,1050,1063,1076,1088,1099,1112,1123,1138,1154,1168,1181,1192,1203,1214,1224,1239,1253,1269,1282,1293,1303,1315,1332,1341,1352,1363,1373,1384,1395,1406,1418,1429,1442,1453,1468,1478,1492,1506,1518,1529,1539,1551,1562,1576,1592,1608,1620,1632,1646,1659,1672,1685,1698,1710,1722,1739,1751,1765,1778,1791,1803,1818,1832,1842,1854,1866,1878,1892,1904,1917,1927,1940,1949,1960,1971,1981,1993,2006,2017,2027,2044,2055,2065,2077,2088,2101,2112,2123,2136,2148,2160,2171,2186,2198,2209,2220,2231,2243,2254,2269,2282,2297,2311,2322,2335,2344,2353,2361,2372,2381,2395,2407,2418,2429,2441,2451,2461,2471,2480,2492,2505,2516,2527,2536,2545,2560,2571,2580,2589,2600,2611,2624,2636,2647,2660,2669,2679,2689,2701,2714,2724,2735,2745,2757,2768,2779,2791,2803,2813,2825,2839,2849,2862,2874,2885,2896,2907,2921,2932,2943,2956,2970,2980,2994,3003,3015,3024,3035,3045,3055,3065,3077,3088,3098,3111,3124,3133,3145,3156,3168,3181,3194,3205,3216,3228,3241,3252,3264,3275,3285,3296,3308,3321,3334,3349,3360,3370,3384,3397,3407,3418,3428,3440,3450,3459,3469,3481,3493,3503,3513,3523,3535,3546,3560,3572,3582,3593,3605,3618,3629,3641,3650,3661,3673,3684,3693,3706,3718,3730,3740,3751,3761,3773,3785,3796,3809,3823,3835,3846,3857,3868,3881,3892,3903,3915,3927,3938,3950,3961,3971,3981,3992,4004,4017,4029,4043,4053,4066,4076,4088,4104,4114,4126,4142,4152,4161,4173,4184,4193,4203,4215,4228,4241,4251,4264,4276,4287,4296,4306,4320,4329,4340,4350,4358,4367,4378,4387,4400,4410,4419,4428,4438,4449,4461,4470,4481,4491,4500,4511,4521,4534,4545,4557,4569,4581,4593,4607,4618,4628,4642,4655,4665,4675,4686,4698,4711,4723,4738,4750,4761,4774,4784,4795,4807,4818,4827,4837,4848,4859,4870,4881,4890,4901,4910,4921,4933,4944,4958,4969,4978,4989,5000,5010,5018,5030,5043,5051,5062,5074,5084,5094,5105,5119,5128,5139,5149,5159,5169,5180,5190,5200,5210,5220,5230,5239,5247,5256,5270,5280,5288,5298,5306,5315,5325,5338,5348,5357,5367,5378,5393,5404,5413,5425,5434,5446,5458,5469,5478,5489,5498,5509,5520,5532,5543,5552,5563,5573,5584,5595,5608,5622,5632,5640,5650,5662,5675,5686,5699,5709,5718,5728,5737,5749,5761,5774,5785,5795,5806,5818,5829,5839,5850,5861,5872,5886,5897,5907,5918,5928,5938,5948,5958,5967,5978,5990,6000,6012,6020,6031,6040,6051,6060,6070,6082,6094,6107,6118,6132,6143,6152,6161,6170,6173,6183,6196,6207,6218,6227,6237,6248,6259,6271,6282,6295,6305,6319,6330,6343,6356,6368,6377,6388,6398,6406,6416,6427,6438,6449,6459,6471,6482,6494,6504,6517,6528,6541,6552,6563,6573,6581,6591,6601,6611,6620,6629,6639,6650,6662,6671,6683,6694,6704,6713,6723,6733,6742,6752,6761,6771,6780,6789,6797,6807,6818,6829,6839,6849,6857,6868,6878,6888,6900,6910,6920,6930,6940,6951,6962,6973,6984,6996,7006,7017,7029,7039,7050,7060,7070,7080,7088,7098,7110,7123,7132,7144,7153,7164,7173,7182,7191,7200,7208,7216,7225,7234,7242,7251,7261,7269,7278,7286,7296,7304,7314,7324,7335,7343,7352,7361],{"id":111,"slug":112,"headline":113,"title":114,"severity":115,"article_type":97,"excerpt":116,"tags":117,"categories":123,"createdAt":125,"updatedAt":125,"displayDate":126,"isUpdated":127,"readingTime":128},"4c85e138-e951-4395-8ecb-e2ecfbbe97d0","ingram-micro-discloses-ransomware-attack-impacting-42000-individuals","Ingram Micro Breach Exposes Data of 42,000 After Safepay Ransomware Attack","Ingram Micro Confirms July 2025 Ransomware Attack Compromised Personal Data of 42,521 Individuals","high","Global IT distributor Ingram Micro has officially notified 42,521 individuals that their personal and sensitive information, including Social Security numbers, was stolen during a ransomware attack in July 2025.
