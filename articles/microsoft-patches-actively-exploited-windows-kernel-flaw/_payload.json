The flaw is an elevation of privilege vulnerability with a CVSS score of 7.0, allowing a local attacker to gain SYSTEM-level access. The vulnerability affects all supported versions of Windows and Windows Server. Due to its active exploitation in the wild, immediate patching is strongly recommended.","## Executive Summary\nFor its November 2025 Patch Tuesday, **[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/security)** has released security updates to fix 63 vulnerabilities, with the most critical being a Windows Kernel vulnerability that is actively being exploited in the wild. The zero-day flaw, tracked as **`CVE-2025-62215`**, is an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) vulnerability that an attacker can use to gain SYSTEM-level privileges on a compromised machine. The vulnerability was reported by Microsoft's own threat intelligence teams, indicating it has been observed in targeted attacks. Given that this flaw is under active exploitation, security administrators are urged to prioritize the deployment of these updates to all affected Windows systems to prevent attackers from gaining full control over them.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerabilities Addressed\nWhile the November release fixed 63 flaws in total, the standout vulnerability is:\n\n- **CVE ID:** `CVE-2025-62215`\n- **Description:** Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n- **CVSS Score:** 7.0 (High)\n- **Exploitation Status:** Actively Exploited (Zero-Day)\n\nThe vulnerability exists due to a race condition that occurs from improper synchronization when the Windows Kernel handles shared resources. An authenticated attacker who has already gained a foothold on a system (e.g., through phishing or another exploit) can run a specially crafted application to exploit this race condition. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute code with SYSTEM privileges, effectively granting them full control of the affected system.\n\nOther notable vulnerabilities in this month's release include 16 for remote code execution and 29 for elevation of privilege, underscoring the ongoing battle against these high-impact flaw types.\n\n---\n\n## Affected Products\n**`CVE-2025-62215`** affects a wide range of **Microsoft** products, including:\n- Windows 10 (all supported versions)\n- Windows 11 (all supported versions)\n- Windows Server 2019, 2022, and later\n\nEssentially, all currently supported desktop and server versions of the Windows operating system are vulnerable.\n\n---\n\n## Impact Assessment\nElevation of Privilege vulnerabilities like **`CVE-2025-62215`** are a crucial component in the modern attack chain. Attackers often gain initial access with low-level user privileges. An EoP flaw allows them to escalate their access to the SYSTEM level, which is necessary to perform actions such as:\n- Disabling security software.\n- Installing persistent backdoors or rootkits.\n- Accessing, modifying, or exfiltrating sensitive data from all users on the system.\n- Moving laterally to other systems on the network.\n\nThe active exploitation of this flaw means that threat actors have an operationalized exploit and are using it in real-world attacks. This significantly increases the risk to unpatched organizations.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Priority\n**CRITICAL.** Due to its status as an actively exploited zero-day, the patch for **`CVE-2025-62215`** should be deployed immediately across all affected systems. Priority should be given to workstations, as they are common initial targets, followed closely by servers.\n\n---\n\n## Installation Instructions\nThe security updates are available via standard distribution channels:\n- **Windows Update / Microsoft Update:** The recommended method for most users and administrators.\n- **Windows Server Update Services (WSUS):** For enterprise environments managing updates centrally.\n- **Microsoft Update Catalog:** For manual download and deployment.\n\nNo further configuration is required after the update is installed. A reboot will be necessary to complete the installation.\n\n### Cyber Observables\n- **Detection:** Monitor for the execution of unsigned or suspicious executables from non-standard directories (e.g., `C:\\Users\\Public\\`).\n- **Hunting:** Use EDR solutions to hunt for processes that are created with low privileges but subsequently spawn child processes with SYSTEM privileges, which could indicate successful exploitation of an EoP flaw. D3FEND's [`Process Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ProcessAnalysis) is a key defensive technique for this.","🚨 PATCH TUESDAY: Microsoft fixes an actively exploited Windows Kernel zero-day (CVE-2025-62215).
