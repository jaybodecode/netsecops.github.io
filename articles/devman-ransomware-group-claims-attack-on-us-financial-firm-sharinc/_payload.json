The claim was made on December 28, 2025, on the group's data leak site. The attackers have threatened to publish sensitive financial and customer data if their extortion demands are not met. This incident underscores the persistent and targeted threat that ransomware gangs pose to the financial services industry, which remains a high-value target due to the sensitive nature of the data it handles.","## Executive Summary\nOn December 28, 2025, the **DevMan** ransomware group added U.S. financial firm **Sharinc Inc.** to its list of victims on its dark web leak site. The group claims to have breached the company's network and exfiltrated sensitive data, specifically citing \"Financial, Customer data.\" DevMan is employing a double extortion tactic, threatening to publish the stolen information to pressure the victim into paying a ransom. This attack highlights the significant and ongoing risk that ransomware operations present to the financial sector, where data confidentiality is paramount.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe **DevMan** ransomware group, while perhaps not as prolific as some top-tier gangs, represents the persistent threat from numerous small to mid-sized ransomware operations. These groups often use similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as their larger counterparts, typically gaining initial access through common vectors like phishing, exploitation of public-facing vulnerabilities, or compromised credentials purchased from initial access brokers.\n\nBy targeting **Sharinc Inc.**, a financial organization, DevMan is aiming for a high-impact attack. The threat to leak customer and financial data is designed to inflict maximum pressure, leveraging the victim's regulatory obligations and the potential for severe reputational damage. This is a classic double extortion strategy: data is encrypted for disruption ([`T1486 - Data Encrypted for Impact`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/)) and stolen for coercion ([`T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041/)).\n\n## Technical Analysis\nWhile specific details of the intrusion at Sharinc Inc. are not public, attacks by groups like DevMan typically follow a recognizable pattern based on the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model:\n1.  **Initial Access:** Often achieved via [`T1566 - Phishing`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/) campaigns, exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services like RDP or VPNs ([`T1133 - External Remote Services`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133/)), or purchasing access from initial access brokers.\n2.  **Execution and Persistence:** Deployment of commodity backdoors or legitimate remote management tools (e.g., AnyDesk, ScreenConnect) to maintain a foothold.\n3.  **Privilege Escalation:** Exploiting local vulnerabilities or using tools like Mimikatz to obtain administrative credentials ([`T1003 - OS Credential Dumping`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/)).\n4.  **Discovery & Lateral Movement:** Scanning the network to identify domain controllers, file servers, and backup systems. Moving laterally using techniques like Pass-the-Hash or compromised RDP credentials.\n5.  **Defense Evasion:** Disabling security software and deleting shadow copies to prevent recovery ([`T1562.001 - Disable or Modify Tools`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001/)).\n6.  **Exfiltration & Impact:** Data is exfiltrated to cloud storage before the ransomware payload is executed across the network.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nA successful ransomware attack on a financial firm like Sharinc Inc. can have devastating consequences:\n- **Financial Loss:** Includes the potential ransom payment, recovery costs, regulatory fines, and lost revenue due to business interruption.\n- **Data Breach:** The public release of customer financial data can lead to widespread fraud, identity theft, and a complete loss of customer trust.\n- **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Financial institutions face strict data protection regulations (e.g., GLBA, NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation). A breach of this nature invites immediate and intense scrutiny from regulators.\n- **Reputational Damage:** The perception of being unable to protect sensitive financial data can be permanently damaging to a financial institution's brand and customer loyalty.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\nGeneral observables for detecting ransomware activity include:\n\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| command_line_pattern | `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet` | Command used to delete Volume Shadow Copies to hinder system recovery. |\n| process_name | `wmic.exe` | Often used by ransomware for remote process execution and lateral movement. |\n| network_traffic_pattern | Large outbound transfers to cloud storage (Mega, Dropbox, etc.) | Indicates data exfiltration prior to encryption. |\n| file_name | `*.devman` | A hypothetical file extension that could be used by the ransomware. Monitor for mass file renaming. |\n\n## Detection & Response\n1.  **Behavioral Monitoring:** Deploy an EDR solution to detect ransomware TTPs, such as the disabling of security tools, deletion of volume shadow copies, and mass file encryption. ([D3-PA: Process Analysis](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ProcessAnalysis))\n2.  **Network Analysis:** Monitor for large, anomalous outbound data flows, especially to consumer cloud storage services not used by the business. This is a key indicator of data exfiltration.\n3.  **Credential Monitoring:** Actively monitor for credential dumping activity using tools like Mimikatz and unusual authentication patterns, such as an administrator account logging into multiple workstations in a short period.\n4.  **Backup Integrity:** Regularly check the integrity and accessibility of backups. Alert on any attempts to access or delete backup files or management consoles.\n\n## Mitigation\n1.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA on all remote access points (VPN, RDP), email accounts, and critical internal systems to prevent initial access via compromised credentials. ([D3-MFA: Multi-factor Authentication](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:Multi-factorAuthentication))\n2.  **Data Backup and Recovery:** Maintain a robust backup strategy with offline and immutable backups that are regularly tested. This ensures data can be recovered without paying a ransom. ([D3-FR: File Restoration](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:FileRestoration))\n3.  **Network Segmentation:** Segment the network to prevent ransomware from spreading. Isolate critical assets, like file servers and databases, from user workstations.\n4.  **Patch Management:** Keep all systems, especially public-facing ones, patched to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.","💸 DevMan ransomware group claims attack on U.S. financial firm Sharinc Inc., threatening to leak customer and financial data.

Crucially, at least one copy of the backups must be immutable or stored offline (air-gapped), making it inaccessible to attackers on the network. This prevents ransomware from encrypting or deleting the backups. Regular, automated testing of the restoration process is non-negotiable to ensure that data can be recovered quickly and reliably, allowing the business to restore operations without considering a ransom payment.",{"technique_id":90,"technique_name":91,"url":92,"recommendation":93,"mitre_mitigation_id":94},"D3-PA","Process Analysis","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ProcessAnalysis","To detect ransomware activity before widespread encryption, organizations should employ Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools capable of advanced process analysis.
