This act of doxing is the latest in a series of campaigns designed to inflict psychological and reputational damage on Israeli intelligence and government officials. Investigations by cybersecurity firm KELA suggest Handala's primary attack vector is not sophisticated device hacking but rather the compromise of messaging applications like Telegram, likely through social engineering or session hijacking. The group, believed to be associated with Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and the 'Banished Kitten' cyber unit, frames these leaks as strategic blows, having previously targeted high-profile figures and released documents related to Israel's Iron Dome system and Unit 8200.","## Executive Summary\nOn January 3, 2026, the Iran-linked hacktivist group **[Handala](https://kela.com/blog/handala-hack-telegram-breach-of-israeli-officials/)** claimed to have exposed the personal details of 15 Israeli Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) officers. This incident is not a result of sophisticated device exploitation but rather a targeted information and psychological warfare operation focused on compromising individual messaging accounts, specifically **[Telegram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(software))**. The group, assessed to be a proxy for Iranian intelligence, is leveraging these high-profile leaks to create an atmosphere of vulnerability and distrust within Israel's defense and intelligence apparatus. The campaign relies on social engineering and session hijacking to gain access to accounts, after which they exfiltrate contact lists and fabricate conversations to maximize psychological impact. This tactic has been used previously against former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and the Chief of Staff for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe threat actor, **Handala**, has been active for several years, conducting a series of cyber operations against Israeli targets. This latest incident, dubbed \"Handala RedWanted,\" involves the doxing of 15 individuals purported to be officers in Israeli SIGINT units. The group published a \"wanted\" list with their names, presenting it as a major intelligence failure for Israel. \n\nHowever, technical analysis from cybersecurity firm **[KELA](https://kela.com)** indicates that Handala's claims of deep system compromise are often exaggerated. Their primary modus operandi involves gaining access to cloud-based services like **Telegram** rather than the physical devices themselves. This is achieved through common attack vectors such as phishing for credentials, tricking users into revealing one-time passwords (OTPs), or exploiting weak session management. The goal is less about gathering sensitive intelligence and more about public humiliation and spreading disinformation. The group's connection to the Iranian threat actor known as **Banished Kitten** suggests a state-sponsored campaign aimed at undermining Israeli national security through low-cost, high-impact psychological operations.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThe attack chain employed by **Handala** is focused on the user, not the technology. Instead of exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, they leverage social engineering and credential theft.\n\n1.  **Reconnaissance ([T1592 - Gather Victim Host Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1592/)):** The actors identify high-value targets within the Israeli government and military.\n2.  **Initial Access ([T1566 - Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/)):** Targets are likely sent spearphishing messages designed to trick them into revealing their **Telegram** login credentials or OTP codes. This could also involve SIM swapping to intercept SMS-based recovery codes.\n3.  **Credential Access ([T1539 - Steal Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539/)):** By gaining access to a user's session token or credentials, the attackers can log into the victim's **Telegram** account from their own infrastructure.\n4.  **Collection ([T1530 - Data from Cloud Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1530/)):** Once inside the account, **Handala** exfiltrates the contact list. As noted by **KELA**, many of the \"leaked chats\" are merely empty contact cards automatically generated by **Telegram's** contact synchronization feature, which the attackers then present as evidence of a full compromise.\n5.  **Impact ([TA0040 - Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0040/)):** The primary impact is not technical but psychological. The collected names and photos are published on social media and pro-Iranian news outlets to create a narrative of a powerful hacking group that has deeply penetrated Israeli intelligence.\n\n> This attack highlights a critical distinction: compromising an application is not the same as compromising a device. The lack of evidence of device-level exploits suggests the targets' phones themselves remained secure, but their online accounts were breached.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe primary impact of Handala's campaign is psychological and reputational. For the affected individuals, being publicly identified as intelligence officers poses a significant personal security risk. For the **[Israeli Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces)** and its intelligence units like **Unit 8200**, the incident creates a perception of vulnerability, which can erode morale and public trust. While no sensitive operational data appears to have been compromised, the campaign forces the organization to expend resources on damage control, internal investigations, and reinforcing security protocols for personnel's personal communications.\n\nOperationally, the impact is low. However, from a counter-intelligence perspective, it is a significant nuisance that could potentially expose networks of contacts if a compromised account was used for any semi-official communication.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n- Monitor for anomalous login activity on corporate or personal messaging applications, especially from unusual geographic locations or IP ranges.\n- Look for a sudden spike in outbound traffic from messaging apps, which could indicate contact list exfiltration.\n- Network traffic to and from IP addresses associated with Iranian state-sponsored actors.\n- Social media and dark web monitoring for mentions of employee names, official titles, or organizational data.\n\n| Type | Value | Description | Context | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| log_source | Telegram | Monitor Telegram login and session logs for anomalies. | Cloud Service Logs | high |\n| network_traffic_pattern | Telegram API | Unusual or high-volume API calls to `api.telegram.org` from non-standard devices or locations. | Network Flow Logs | medium |\n| user_account_pattern | Doxbin/Pastebin | Proactive searches on paste sites for employee names or email addresses. | OSINT | high |\n\n## Detection & Response\nDetection of such attacks is challenging as it occurs on third-party platforms. Key strategies include:\n- **User Training:** Educate high-risk employees to recognize phishing attempts targeting their personal and work accounts. Emphasize the dangers of sharing OTPs and the importance of unique, strong passwords for every service.\n- **Behavioral Analysis:** Use **[D3-UBA: User Behavior Analysis](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:UserBehaviorAnalysis)** to monitor for unusual account access patterns. An Israeli official's **Telegram** account suddenly being accessed from an IP in Tehran should trigger an immediate alert.\n- **Incident Response Playbook:** Have a specific playbook for doxing incidents, including legal, PR, and personal security support for affected employees. The first step should be to secure the account, revoke all active sessions, and change the password.\n\n## Mitigation\n- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Mandate the use of app-based MFA (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy) instead of SMS-based MFA, which is vulnerable to SIM swapping. This is a core component of **[D3-MFA: Multi-factor Authentication](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:Multi-factorAuthentication)**.\n- **Session Management:** Regularly review and terminate old or unused sessions in all cloud and messaging applications. Instruct users on how to do this in their personal apps like **Telegram** (`Settings > Devices`).\n- **Application Hardening:** Advise personnel to configure privacy settings within applications to the highest level. For **Telegram**, this includes hiding their phone number and limiting who can find them by their number. This aligns with **[D3-ACH: Application Configuration Hardening](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ApplicationConfigurationHardening)**.\n- **Restrict Work on Personal Apps:** Enforce strict policies prohibiting the use of personal messaging apps for official communication. Provide sanctioned, secure communication channels for all work-related matters.","⚠️ Iran-linked Handala group doxed 15 Israeli SIGINT officers in a targeted info-war campaign.

Prioritize hardware tokens (FIDO2/WebAuthn) or authenticator apps over SMS-based MFA, which is susceptible to SIM-swapping attacks—a common tactic in targeted campaigns. For an organization like the Israeli military, this should be a mandatory policy. This directly mitigates the primary attack vector used by Handala: credential and session theft. Even if an attacker successfully phishes a user's password, they cannot complete the login without the second factor. This transforms the attack from a simple credential compromise into a much more complex real-time session hijacking attempt, significantly raising the bar for the attacker.",{"technique_id":118,"technique_name":119,"url":120,"recommendation":135,"mitre_mitigation_id":110},"While direct monitoring of personal apps like Telegram is not feasible for an organization, high-risk individuals should be educated on how to monitor their own account activity. Furthermore, for any corporate-sanctioned applications, implement User Geolocation Logon Pattern Analysis. This involves establishing a baseline of normal login locations for each user and flagging or blocking logins from anomalous or impossible-to-travel-to locations. For example, if a known Israeli-based officer's account suddenly has a login attempt from Iran, the system should automatically block the attempt and trigger a high-priority alert. This requires a SIEM or identity and access management (IAM) solution capable of ingesting and correlating geolocation data with authentication logs.
