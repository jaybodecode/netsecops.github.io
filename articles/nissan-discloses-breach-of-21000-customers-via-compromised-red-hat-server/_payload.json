The incident was a result of a supply chain attack, originating from the compromise of a Red Hat-managed GitLab server. This server was used by a third-party contractor developing a customer management system for a Nissan dealership. Red Hat detected the initial unauthorized access on September 26, 2025, and notified Nissan on October 3. The exposed data includes customer names, addresses, phone numbers, and partial email addresses. The extortion group ShinyHunters and a group called 'Crimson Collective' have been linked to the initial attack on Red Hat's infrastructure.","## Executive Summary\nOn December 22, 2025, **[Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.](https://www.nissan-global.com/)** disclosed a data breach impacting approximately 21,000 customers. This was a supply chain incident, where the breach did not occur on Nissan's core systems but on a third-party server managed by **[Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/)**. The compromised system was a **[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)** server used by a contractor for software development related to a dealership customer management system. The breach, initially detected by Red Hat in late September, exposed customer PII including names, addresses, and phone numbers. The incident highlights the significant risks associated with third-party vendors and the software development lifecycle. The threat actor groups **Crimson Collective** and **ShinyHunters** have been associated with the attack.\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe attack chain began with the compromise of Red Hat's infrastructure, an incident claimed by a group called 'Crimson Collective.' The notorious extortion group **ShinyHunters** later became involved, publicizing data samples to pressure victims. The unauthorized access on Red Hat's systems was first detected on September 26, 2025. The compromised asset was a GitLab server used for developing a customer management system for Nissan Fukuoka Sales Co., Ltd. On October 3, 2025, Red Hat notified Nissan of the breach. The exposed data pertains to customers who purchased vehicles or received services from that specific dealership. Nissan has confirmed that sensitive financial data like credit card numbers was not stored on the affected server and was not compromised.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThe breach originated from a compromised software development environment, a common vector for supply chain attacks.\n\n### TTPs and MITRE ATT&CK Mapping\n- **[`T1199 - Trusted Relationship`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199/):** The attackers exploited the trusted relationship between Nissan and its third-party contractors (Red Hat and the development firm). By compromising the vendor, they gained access to Nissan's data.\n- **[`T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/):** It is likely the attackers gained initial access to the GitLab server by exploiting a vulnerability in the platform or its associated services.\n- **[`T1552.006 - Unsecured Credentials: Git Roles`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/006/):** Once on the server, attackers could have accessed data by exploiting misconfigured permissions or unsecured credentials within the GitLab repositories.\n- **[`T1530 - Data from Cloud Storage Object`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1530/):** The attackers exfiltrated customer data that was stored or processed within the compromised development environment.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe direct impact is the exposure of personal information for 21,000 Nissan customers, placing them at risk of phishing, smishing, and other social engineering attacks. For Nissan, the incident causes significant reputational damage and erodes customer trust, despite the breach occurring at a third party. It also necessitates a costly response, including customer notification, credit monitoring services, and regulatory reporting to Japan's Personal Information Protection Commission. For Red Hat, the incident damages its reputation as a secure service provider. The event underscores the principle that an organization can outsource services, but it cannot outsource the ultimate responsibility for protecting its data.\n\n## Detection & Response\n1.  **Third-Party Monitoring:** Continuously monitor and audit logs from third-party managed systems, especially those handling sensitive data. Insist on access to security logs as part of vendor contracts.\n2.  **Code Repository Auditing:** Regularly audit code repositories like GitLab for anomalous activity, such as large data clones, access from unusual IP addresses, or unexpected changes in user permissions.\n3.  **Incident Response Plan:** Ensure incident response plans explicitly cover supply chain incidents, with clear protocols for communication and data sharing with affected vendors and customers.\n4.  **D3FEND Techniques:** Implement **[D3-RAPA: Resource Access Pattern Analysis](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ResourceAccessPatternAnalysis)** to detect deviations from normal developer access patterns within the GitLab environment. Use **[D3-UGLPA: User Geolocation Logon Pattern Analysis](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:UserGeolocationLogonPatternAnalysis)** to flag suspicious logins to developer accounts.\n\n## Mitigation\n1.  **Vendor Risk Management:** Implement a robust vendor risk management program. This includes thorough security assessments before onboarding, contractual requirements for security controls and breach notification, and regular audits.\n2.  **Data Minimization:** Enforce data minimization principles with third parties. Contractors should only have access to the absolute minimum data required for their function. Production customer PII should not be used in development environments.\n3.  **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC):** Mandate that all third-party developers adhere to a secure SDLC. This includes code scanning (SAST/DAST), dependency checking, and secure configuration of development tools like GitLab.\n4.  **Strong Authentication:** Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all access to development platforms and code repositories for both internal employees and third-party contractors.\n5.  **D3FEND Countermeasures:** Harden development environments using **[D3-ACH: Application Configuration Hardening](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ApplicationConfigurationHardening)** for tools like GitLab. Enforce strict **[D3-UAP: User Account Permissions](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:UserAccountPermissions)** to ensure developers cannot access data beyond their specific project scope.","🚗 Nissan discloses data breach affecting 21,000 customers.

Organizations must enforce strict configuration policies for all development platforms, whether managed internally or by a third party. This includes disabling public project visibility, enforcing mandatory multi-factor authentication for all users, and setting up granular repository permissions to ensure developers can only access code relevant to their tasks. Furthermore, production data and secrets (like API keys or credentials) must never be stored in code repositories. Use a dedicated secrets management solution like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager, and ensure development environments are configured to pull secrets dynamically at runtime rather than storing them in code or configuration files. Regular configuration audits of these platforms are necessary to catch any security drift.",{"technique_id":99,"technique_name":100,"url":101,"recommendation":116,"mitre_mitigation_id":95},"The compromised GitLab server, although managed by a third party, should have been placed in a logically isolated network segment. Access to development and CI/CD infrastructure should be tightly controlled. Implement firewall rules that restrict access to these servers to specific, known IP addresses, such as corporate VPN endpoints or trusted office locations. Prohibit direct access from the public internet. For a case like Nissan's, this means ensuring that the Red Hat-managed server was only accessible by the specific contractor's authorized IP range and Nissan's oversight team, not the open internet. This simple network control drastically reduces the attack surface available to threat actors seeking to exploit public-facing applications.",{"technique_id":118,"technique_name":119,"url":120,"recommendation":121,"mitre_mitigation_id":122},"D3-UDTA","User Data Transfer Analysis","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:UserDataTransferAnalysis","To detect and prevent data exfiltration from development environments, organizations should monitor outbound network traffic for anomalies.

An alert should be triggered if the volume of outbound data from the server suddenly spikes, or if data is being sent to an unrecognized or suspicious destination. In the Nissan case, monitoring could have detected the exfiltration of the 21,000 customer records as an anomalous data flow, potentially allowing for a faster response to contain the breach before the data was fully siphoned off by the attackers.","M1040",[],[125,131,136],{"type":126,"value":127,"description":128,"context":129,"confidence":130},"api_endpoint","/api/v4/projects","GitLab API endpoint for projects.
