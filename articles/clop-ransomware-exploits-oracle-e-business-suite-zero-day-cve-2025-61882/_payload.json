The flaw, which has a CVSS score of 9.8, allows for unauthenticated remote code execution and has been used to steal data from numerous organizations since at least August 2025. The attackers exfiltrated data for weeks before sending extortion demands in late September. In response, Oracle released an emergency patch on October 4, 2025, and CISA has added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, mandating a patch deadline for federal agencies.","## Executive Summary\nThis report details the active exploitation of a critical, unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, **[CVE-2025-61882](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-61882)**, in **[Oracle](https://www.oracle.com)** E-Business Suite (EBS). The vulnerability, which scores 9.8 on the CVSS scale, is being leveraged by the **[Cl0p](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0108/)** ransomware group (also tracked as Graceful Spider) in a widespread data theft campaign. Exploitation began as early as August 2025, well before the flaw was publicly disclosed. The attackers exfiltrated large volumes of data from dozens of organizations before initiating extortion attempts in late September 2025. **[CISA](https://www.cisa.gov)** has added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, underscoring the urgency for organizations to apply the emergency patch released by Oracle on October 4, 2025.\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe threat actor **Cl0p** has a history of exploiting vulnerabilities in secure file transfer and enterprise software. In this campaign, they targeted a flaw in the BI Publisher Integration module of the Oracle Concurrent Processing component within Oracle E-Business Suite versions 12.2.3 through 12.2.14. The zero-day allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to achieve RCE via a specially crafted HTTP request, requiring no user credentials or interaction. According to **[Mandiant](https://www.mandiant.com)**, Cl0p combined this zero-day with other previously patched vulnerabilities to maximize their access and steal data. After a period of silent data exfiltration, the group began contacting victims with ransom demands, threatening to leak the stolen information if payment is not made.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThe attack chain leverages the **CVE-2025-61882** vulnerability to gain an initial foothold. The flaw is reportedly a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) issue that can be escalated to full RCE. This allows attackers to force the vulnerable EBS server to make unauthorized requests to internal or external resources, bypassing firewall rules and gaining access to sensitive internal systems.\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK Techniques\n- [`T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/): The primary vector, exploiting the zero-day in the internet-facing Oracle EBS.\n- [`T1595.002 - Vulnerability Scanning`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595/002/): Attackers likely scanned the internet for vulnerable Oracle EBS instances before launching the campaign.\n- [`T1212 - Exploitation for Credential Access`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212/): The SSRF flaw may be used to access internal metadata services or other resources to steal credentials.\n- [`T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041/): After gaining control, Cl0p exfiltrated large volumes of data over encrypted channels.\n- [`T1486 - Data Encrypted for Impact`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/): While the primary goal reported is data theft for extortion, Cl0p's standard modus operandi includes encryption as a final step.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe business impact is severe. Oracle EBS is a critical system for many large enterprises, managing financials, supply chain, and human resources. The theft of data from these systems can lead to significant financial loss, regulatory fines (under GDPR, etc.), reputational damage, and business disruption. The exfiltrated data likely contains highly sensitive corporate information, employee PII, and customer data. Organizations that have not patched are at immediate risk of a full compromise, data leakage, and a potential ransomware event.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\nSecurity teams should hunt for the following indicators:\n\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| url_pattern | `*/OA_HTML/BIPublisherIntegration*` | Suspicious requests to the vulnerable BI Publisher Integration endpoint. |\n| url_pattern | `*/xmlpserver/*` | Unusual activity related to the BI Publisher component. |\n| process_name | `java.exe` | Monitor for child processes spawned by the Oracle EBS Java process that are unusual (e.g., `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`). |\n| network_traffic_pattern | High-volume outbound traffic from EBS servers | Look for large data transfers from EBS servers to unknown or suspicious IP addresses, especially cloud hosting providers. |\n| log_source | `Oracle EBS Access Logs` | Review for anomalous GET/POST requests, especially those with unusual parameters or from untrusted IP ranges. |\n\n## Detection & Response\n1.  **Log Analysis**: Immediately review Oracle EBS access logs, web server logs, and network traffic logs for any requests targeting the `BIPublisherIntegration` module or other suspicious patterns originating from unknown IP addresses. Use D3FEND's [`Network Traffic Analysis (D3-NTA)`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkTrafficAnalysis) to baseline normal traffic and detect anomalies.\n2.  **Endpoint Detection**: Deploy and monitor EDR solutions on Oracle EBS servers. Look for suspicious process chains, such as the EBS application server process spawning shell commands or PowerShell scripts. Use D3FEND's [`Process Analysis (D3-PA)`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ProcessAnalysis) to identify malicious behavior.\n3.  **Threat Hunting**: Proactively hunt for signs of compromise. Check for newly created files in web-accessible directories, unexpected scheduled tasks, or new user accounts on the underlying server. Search for outbound connections to known malicious infrastructure or cloud storage providers not used by your organization.\n\n## Mitigation\n1.  **Immediate Patching**: The most critical action is to apply the emergency patch for **CVE-2025-61882** released by **Oracle** on October 4, 2025. Note that the October 2023 Critical Patch Update is a prerequisite. This falls under D3FEND's [`Software Update (D3-SU)`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SoftwareUpdate).\n2.  **Restrict Access**: If patching is not immediately possible, restrict all external access to the Oracle E-Business Suite web interface. Place it behind a VPN or a reverse proxy with a strict web application firewall (WAF) rule set to filter malicious requests. This aligns with D3FEND's [`Inbound Traffic Filtering (D3-ITF)`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:InboundTrafficFiltering).\n3.  **Network Segmentation**: Isolate the EBS servers from the rest of the corporate network to prevent lateral movement. Implement strict firewall rules that only allow necessary communication to and from the servers. This is a core principle of D3FEND's [`Network Isolation (D3-NI)`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkIsolation).\n4.  **Backup and Recovery**: Ensure you have recent, tested, and offline backups of your Oracle EBS data and system configurations to facilitate recovery in the event of a ransomware attack.","üö® CRITICAL: Cl0p ransomware exploits Oracle E-Business Suite zero-day (CVE-2025-61882) in a massive data theft campaign.

These rules should inspect HTTP/S traffic for patterns associated with the exploit, such as malicious strings in requests targeting the `/OA_HTML/BIPublisherIntegration` endpoint. Furthermore, general access to the EBS application should be restricted to only trusted IP ranges and be placed behind a mandatory VPN for all administrative access.
