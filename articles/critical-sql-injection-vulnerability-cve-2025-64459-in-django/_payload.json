The flaw affects Django versions 4.2, 5.1, 5.2, and the 6.0 beta. It allows an attacker to manipulate database queries by passing a specially crafted dictionary to certain ORM methods, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or authentication bypass. Due to the widespread use of Django and the low complexity of the attack, developers are strongly urged to upgrade to the patched versions (4.2.26, 5.1.14, 5.2.8) immediately.","## Executive Summary\nOn November 5, 2025, the **[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)** security team disclosed and patched a **critical** SQL injection vulnerability, **[CVE-2025-64459](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64459)**. The flaw has a CVSS v3.1 score of 9.1, reflecting its severity and ease of exploitation. It exists within the framework's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) component and can be triggered when a dictionary with dictionary expansion is used as a `_connector` argument in specific `QuerySet` methods. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary SQL commands, leading to a complete compromise of the application's data confidentiality and integrity. Patches have been released in Django versions `5.2.8`, `5.1.14`, and `4.2.26`. All organizations using affected Django versions are urged to upgrade immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2025-64459** is a classic SQL injection flaw but with a novel entry point through the Django ORM's internal mechanisms. The flaw resides in how the `QuerySet.filter()`, `QuerySet.exclude()`, and `QuerySet.get()` methods handle dictionary expansion (`**kwargs`) when used with a specific internal parameter.\n\nAn attacker can exploit this by crafting a dictionary where a key is `_connector` and passing it to one of the vulnerable methods using dictionary expansion. For example:\n`MyModel.objects.filter(**{\"_connector\": \"' OR 1=1 --\"})`\n\nNormally, the `_connector` argument is used internally to specify logical operators (AND/OR). However, the vulnerability arises because the framework failed to properly sanitize this parameter when it was supplied through user-controlled dictionary expansion, allowing raw SQL to be injected directly into the `WHERE` clause of the database query.\n\nA second, less severe denial-of-service vulnerability, `CVE-2025-64458`, was also patched in the same release, affecting applications on Windows.\n\n## Affected Systems\nThe vulnerability affects the following supported and pre-release versions of Django:\n-   Django 5.2 (before version 5.2.8)\n-   Django 5.1 (before version 5.1.14)\n-   Django 4.2 (before version 4.2.26)\n-   Django 6.0 (beta versions)\n\nOlder, unsupported versions of Django are also likely to be affected.\n\n## Exploitation Status\nThere are no public reports of in-the-wild exploitation at the time of disclosure. However, the low complexity of the attack and the public availability of technical details mean that exploits are likely to be developed and used quickly. Proactive patching is essential.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nSuccessful exploitation of **CVE-2025-64459** can have severe consequences, including:\n-   **Data Exfiltration**: Attackers can bypass access controls and read any data from the application's database, including user credentials, personal information, and financial records.\n-   **Authentication Bypass**: An attacker could manipulate login queries to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to privileged accounts.\n-   **Data Modification/Deletion**: Attackers could alter or delete records in the database, corrupting data and disrupting business operations.\n-   **Denial of Service**: Malicious queries could be crafted to overload the database server, causing a denial of service.\n-   **Potential for RCE**: Depending on the database configuration and permissions, SQL injection can sometimes be escalated to achieve remote code execution on the database server.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n| Type | Value | Description | Context | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| url_pattern | `_connector=` in query parameters | A URL query string containing the `_connector` parameter could be an indicator of an exploitation attempt. | Monitor web server access logs and WAF logs for this specific parameter name. | high |\n| log_source | `Database Query Logs` | SQL queries containing logical inconsistencies like `... WHERE (' OR 1=1 -- ...)` | Enable and monitor database query logs for malformed or suspicious SQL statements. | high |\n| other | Application errors related to malformed SQL queries | Unsuccessful exploit attempts may trigger database errors that are logged by the Django application. | Monitor application error logs for `DatabaseError` or similar exceptions. | medium |\n\n## Detection Methods\n1.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Deploy a WAF with rules specifically designed to detect and block SQL injection patterns. A custom rule could be created to block any request containing `_connector` as a query parameter, as this is not a standard use case.\n2.  **Static and Dynamic Analysis (SAST/DAST)**: Use SAST tools to scan Django codebases for instances where user-controlled dictionaries are passed directly to `filter()`, `exclude()`, or `get()` methods. DAST tools can be used to actively probe running applications for the vulnerability.\n3.  **Code Review**: Manually review code that constructs dynamic `QuerySet` filters based on user input to ensure it does not allow for the injection of the `_connector` key.\n\n## Remediation Steps\n1.  **Upgrade Django**: The primary and most effective remediation is to upgrade to a patched version of the framework. Developers should upgrade according to their current version branch:\n    -   If on 5.2.x, upgrade to **Django 5.2.8**\n    -   If on 5.1.x, upgrade to **Django 5.1.14**\n    -   If on 4.2.x, upgrade to **Django 4.2.26**\n    This is a direct application of **[D3-SU: Software Update](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SoftwareUpdate)**.\n2.  **Input Validation (Workaround)**: If immediate upgrade is not possible, developers must implement strict validation on any user-controlled data that is used to construct a dictionary for `QuerySet` methods. Ensure that keys like `_connector` are explicitly stripped out before being passed to the ORM. This is a form of **[D3-ACH: Application Configuration Hardening](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ApplicationConfigurationHardening)**.","Django developers: Patch now!

The upgrade path is straightforward: `pip install --upgrade django==\u003Cpatched_version>`. For example, an application on Django 4.2.25 must be upgraded to 4.2.26. After upgrading, teams must run their full test suite to ensure no regressions were introduced.

A key component of this is deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of all Django applications. The WAF should be configured with a robust, up-to-date ruleset for detecting SQL injection attacks. Specifically for this CVE, a custom WAF rule should be created to inspect all incoming HTTP requests (GET and POST) and block any that contain the string `_connector=` in the query parameters or request body. Since this is an internal ORM parameter that should never be exposed to or controlled by an end-user, this rule would have a very low false-positive rate and would effectively block exploitation attempts, even before the application itself is patched.
