Post-exploitation, the attackers deploy Velociraptor, a legitimate digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) tool, for reconnaissance and persistence. By abusing a trusted tool, the attackers blend in with normal administrative activity, evading detection. In several confirmed incidents, this attack chain culminates in the deployment of the Warlock ransomware. This 'living-off-the-land' technique highlights a sophisticated approach to facilitating ransomware attacks.","## Executive Summary\nThe threat actor **Storm-2603** is conducting a sophisticated ransomware campaign that begins with the exploitation of a vulnerability chain in **[Microsoft SharePoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration)**. The flaws, tracked as **CVE-2025-49706** and **CVE-2025-49704** (collectively 'ToolShell'), are used to gain initial access to enterprise networks. In a clever 'living-off-the-land' (LotL) tactic, the attackers then deploy **[Velociraptor](https://www.velocidex.com/)**, a legitimate and powerful open-source digital forensics tool. By abusing this trusted tool, **Storm-2603** can perform reconnaissance, move laterally, and maintain persistence while evading detection. The ultimate goal of the campaign is to deploy the **Warlock** ransomware as the final payload, encrypting victim data for extortion. This campaign showcases the growing trend of threat actors co-opting legitimate security tools for malicious purposes.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\n*   **Threat Actor**: **Storm-2603**.\n*   **Initial Access Vector**: Exploitation of a vulnerability chain in Microsoft SharePoint (**CVE-2025-49706** and **CVE-2025-49704**).\n*   **Key Tool**: **Velociraptor**, a legitimate DFIR tool, is abused for post-exploitation activities.\n*   **Final Payload**: **Warlock** ransomware.\n*   **Primary Tactic**: Living-off-the-Land (LotL), specifically 'living-off-the-trusted-security-tool', to blend in and avoid detection.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThe attack proceeds in several distinct phases:\n\n1.  **Initial Access**: **Storm-2603** scans for and exploits internet-facing Microsoft SharePoint servers vulnerable to the 'ToolShell' chain (**CVE-2025-49706**, **CVE-2025-49704**). Successful exploitation likely results in remote code execution on the SharePoint server ([`T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/)).\n2.  **Persistence and C2**: The attackers deploy the **Velociraptor** agent on compromised systems. Velociraptor is designed to have a client-server architecture, which the attackers abuse to establish a persistent command-and-control channel. The agent on the compromised host connects back to an attacker-controlled Velociraptor server, allowing them to issue commands and run queries remotely ([`T1219 - Remote Access Software`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1219/)).\n3.  **Discovery and Lateral Movement**: Using Velociraptor's powerful query language (VQL), the attackers perform extensive reconnaissance. They can inventory systems, search for sensitive files, dump credentials, and identify high-value targets like domain controllers and backup servers. The tool's legitimate status means its activity is less likely to be flagged by EDR solutions compared to known hacking tools ([`T1047 - Windows Management Instrumentation`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/) and [`T1059.001 - PowerShell`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/) are often used by Velociraptor's underlying artifacts).\n4.  **Impact**: Once the attackers have mapped the network and escalated privileges, they use their access to deploy the **Warlock** ransomware across multiple systems, encrypting data and demanding a ransom ([`T1486 - Data Encrypted for Impact`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/)).\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe use of a legitimate DFIR tool like Velociraptor makes this campaign particularly dangerous:\n*   **Detection Evasion**: The malware's activities can be easily mistaken for legitimate administrative or incident response work, delaying detection and allowing the attackers more dwell time to achieve their objectives.\n*   **Full Network Compromise**: Velociraptor provides deep system-level access, enabling the attackers to achieve a comprehensive compromise of the network before deploying ransomware.\n*   **Destructive Outcome**: The final payload is **Warlock** ransomware, which can cause catastrophic business disruption, data loss, and significant financial costs related to recovery and ransom payments.\n\n## Detection & Response\nDetecting the malicious use of a legitimate tool requires a focus on behavior and context:\n*   **Monitor for Unauthorized Deployments**: The presence of the `velociraptor.exe` binary or its associated configuration files on systems where it has not been intentionally deployed by the security team is a major red flag. Use EDR to hunt for this executable.\n*   **Network Traffic Analysis**: The Velociraptor agent will communicate with its C2 server. Monitor for outbound connections from endpoints to unknown or untrusted IP addresses on the ports used by Velociraptor (typically TCP/8000 for the frontend). This aligns with D3FEND's [`D3-NTA: Network Traffic Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkTrafficAnalysis).\n*   **Behavioral Analysis**: Even if the tool is legitimate, its use by an attacker will generate anomalous activity. Look for Velociraptor being used to execute reconnaissance queries or deploy files outside of a known incident response engagement. Correlate its activity with other suspicious events.\n\n## Mitigation\n1.  **Patch SharePoint Servers**: The first line of defense is to immediately patch the SharePoint vulnerabilities (**CVE-2025-49706**, **CVE-2025-49704**). This removes the initial access vector.\n2.  **Application Allowlisting**: Implement application control policies to prevent the execution of unauthorized software. If your organization does not use Velociraptor, add its executable hash to a denylist. If you do use it, ensure your policy only allows your specific, signed version to run. This is a key application of D3FEND's [`D3-EAL: Executable Allowlisting`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ExecutableAllowlisting).\n3.  **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure that service accounts for applications like SharePoint have the minimum necessary privileges. This can limit an attacker's ability to move laterally after the initial compromise.\n4.  **Network Segmentation**: Segmenting the network can prevent attackers from moving from a compromised SharePoint server to more critical parts of the network, such as domain controllers.","Ransomware alert: Storm-2603 exploits SharePoint flaws (CVE-2025-49706) to deploy Warlock ransomware.
