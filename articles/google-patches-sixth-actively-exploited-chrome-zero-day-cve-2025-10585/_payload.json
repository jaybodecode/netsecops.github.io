This marks the sixth time in 2025 that Google has patched a Chrome zero-day vulnerability that was being actively exploited in the wild. The flaw could allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on a victim's machine by tricking them into visiting a malicious website. All users of Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers are urged to update immediately.","## Executive Summary\n**[Google](https://www.google.com)** has released an urgent security update for its **[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)** browser, patching a high-severity zero-day vulnerability tracked as **[CVE-2025-10585](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10585)**. The vulnerability is a type confusion flaw in the V8 JavaScript engine and is confirmed to be under active exploitation in the wild. This incident represents the sixth actively exploited Chrome zero-day addressed by Google in 2025, underscoring the persistent efforts by threat actors to target web browsers. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to compromise a user's system. Immediate updates are recommended for all users of Chrome and other browsers based on the Chromium project.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n- **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-10585\n- **Vulnerability Type:** Type Confusion\n- **Affected Component:** V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine\n- **Severity:** High\n\nA type confusion vulnerability occurs when a program allocates or initializes a resource (such as an object or variable) using one type, but later accesses that resource using a different, incompatible type. In the context of the V8 engine, this can corrupt memory in a way that allows an attacker to write to arbitrary memory locations, ultimately leading to remote code execution (RCE) within the context of the browser's sandbox.\n\n### Attack Vector\nThe attack is initiated when a user navigates to a specially crafted or compromised website. The website contains malicious JavaScript code that triggers the type confusion vulnerability in the V8 engine. If successful, the attacker can execute their own code on the victim's machine. While this code execution is typically constrained by the browser's sandbox, attackers often chain such exploits with a second vulnerability (a sandbox escape) to gain full control over the underlying operating system.\n\n## Affected Systems\n- **Google Chrome:** Versions prior to the patched release (users should update to the latest version available).\n- **Other Chromium-based Browsers:** Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi, and others are also potentially affected and will require updates from their respective vendors.\n\n## Exploitation Status\n- **Active Exploitation:** Google has confirmed that an exploit for **CVE-2025-10585** exists in the wild.\n- **Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Google's own **[Threat Analysis Group (TAG)](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/)** on September 16, 2025, indicating it was likely found being used in targeted attacks.\n- **Details Withheld:** To prevent wider abuse, Google is currently restricting access to technical details and links related to the bug.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nA successful exploit of **CVE-2025-10585** allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's computer. This can lead to:\n- **Installation of Malware:** Dropping spyware, ransomware, or other malicious software.\n- **Credential Theft:** Stealing saved passwords, session cookies, and other sensitive data from the browser.\n- **System Compromise:** If chained with a sandbox escape, the attacker could gain full control of the host operating system.\n\nGiven that the browser is the primary interface to the internet for most users, browser-based zero-days are a critical threat to both individuals and organizations.\n\n## Detection Methods\nDetecting exploitation of a browser vulnerability at the endpoint level is extremely difficult without a sophisticated EDR solution that can monitor for memory corruption or anomalous process behavior originating from the browser process. For most organizations, detection is not a practical defense. The primary defense is prevention through patching.\n- **EDR Monitoring:** Look for `chrome.exe` (or equivalent browser process) spawning suspicious child processes like `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe`.\n- **Network Analysis:** Monitor for connections from browser processes to known malicious IP addresses or domains, although sophisticated attackers will use clean infrastructure.\n\n## Remediation Steps\n- **Update Immediately:** The only effective remediation is to ensure all instances of Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers are updated to the latest version. Google Chrome's update will be rolled out automatically, but users can force the update by navigating to `Help > About Google Chrome`.\n- **Enable Automatic Updates:** Ensure that automatic updates are enabled for all browsers across the organization to minimize the window of exposure for future zero-days.\n- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users should not run with local administrator privileges for daily tasks. This can limit the impact of a successful browser compromise.","🚨 Google patches its SIXTH actively exploited Chrome zero-day of 2025!

Furthermore, advanced endpoint protection or EDR solutions can provide additional layers of process protection, such as preventing a sandboxed browser process from writing to certain memory areas or calling specific OS APIs. This acts as a secondary defense to prevent a successful RCE within the sandbox from being chained with a second exploit to escape the sandbox and compromise the host system.","M1038",{"technique_id":106,"technique_name":107,"url":108,"recommendation":138,"mitre_mitigation_id":78},"As a preventative measure, organizations should deploy web security gateways or DNS filtering services that perform real-time URL analysis.
