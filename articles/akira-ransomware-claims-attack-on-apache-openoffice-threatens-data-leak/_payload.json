The threat actors claim to have exfiltrated 23 gigabytes of data from the Apache Software Foundation, including financial records, internal documents, and employee personally identifiable information (PII). As of November 1, 2025, the alleged breach has not been confirmed by the Apache Software Foundation, leaving the scope and authenticity of the claim unverified.","## Executive Summary\nThe **[Akira](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/akira)** ransomware operation has publicly claimed responsibility for a cyberattack against the **[Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/)**, specifically targeting its **[Apache OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/)** project. The group posted the claim on its dark web leak site, asserting the exfiltration of 23 GB of sensitive data. The allegedly stolen information includes financial records, confidential files, and employee PII such as Social Security numbers and credit card details. This incident, if confirmed, would represent a significant breach of a major open-source software provider, leveraging a double-extortion tactic where data is both encrypted and stolen for leverage.\n\n## Threat Overview\n**Akira** is a well-established Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operation known for targeting hundreds of organizations globally since its emergence two years ago. The group is notorious for its double-extortion model, where they first exfiltrate large volumes of data ([`T1567.002 - Exfiltration Over Web Service`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/002/)) before encrypting the victim's files ([`T1486 - Data Encrypted for Impact`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/)). In this case, Akira has threatened to leak the 23 GB of stolen corporate data if their ransom demands are not met. The Apache Software Foundation has remained silent on the matter, so the claims are currently unverified. The initial access vector for the alleged attack is unknown.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nWhile the specific TTPs for this alleged breach are not public, Akira's typical attack pattern involves:\n1.  **Initial Access**: The group often gains entry through compromised VPN credentials, particularly those without multi-factor authentication, or by exploiting known vulnerabilities in public-facing applications.\n2.  **Discovery and Lateral Movement**: Once inside a network, Akira operators use tools like `netscan` to map the internal network and identify valuable targets like domain controllers and file servers. They move laterally using protocols like RDP and SMB.\n3.  **Credential Access**: The group is known to use tools like **[Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002/)** to dump credentials from memory, allowing them to escalate privileges and gain widespread access.\n4.  **Data Exfiltration**: Before deploying the ransomware, they use tools like `Rclone` or `FileZilla` to exfiltrate sensitive data to cloud storage controlled by the attackers.\n5.  **Impact**: Finally, they deploy their multi-platform ransomware payload, which encrypts files across the network and deletes volume shadow copies to hinder recovery.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nIf Akira's claims are true, the impact on the Apache Software Foundation could be severe. The leak of financial records and internal documents could expose strategic information and create legal liabilities. The exposure of employee PII, including Social Security numbers and credit card details, would constitute a major personal data breach, triggering regulatory scrutiny, potential fines, and significant harm to the affected individuals. Furthermore, a successful attack on a trusted software provider like Apache could erode user trust and raise concerns about the integrity of the OpenOffice software itself, even if the code repository was not compromised.\n\n## Detection & Response\n-   **Monitor for Data Staging**: Look for large, compressed files (`.zip`, `.7z`) in unusual locations, which can be a precursor to exfiltration.\n-   **Network Traffic Analysis ([`D3-NTA`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkTrafficAnalysis))**: Monitor outbound network traffic for unusually large data transfers, especially to unfamiliar cloud storage providers or IP addresses.\n-   **Credential Dumping Detection**: Use EDR and security tools to detect and block processes attempting to access the LSASS process memory, a common technique for credential theft.\n-   **Behavioral Analysis**: Look for legitimate tools like `Rclone` or `FileZilla` being used in anomalous ways, such as running under a service account to transfer data out of the network.\n\n## Mitigation\nOrganizations can defend against Akira and similar ransomware threats with a defense-in-depth strategy.\n\n1.  **Multi-Factor Authentication ([`M1032 - Multi-factor Authentication`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1032/))**: Enforce MFA on all external access points, especially VPNs, to prevent initial access via compromised credentials.\n2.  **Network Segmentation ([`M1030 - Network Segmentation`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1030/))**: Segment networks to limit an attacker's ability to move laterally. Critical systems should be isolated from general user networks.\n3.  **Immutable Backups**: Maintain regular, offline, and immutable backups of critical data. Test restoration procedures frequently to ensure they can be relied upon in an emergency.\n4.  **Software Updates ([`M1051 - Update Software`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1051/))**: Keep all software and systems, particularly those that are internet-facing, patched and up-to-date to close known vulnerability-based entry points.","💻 Akira ransomware claims it has breached Apache OpenOffice, alleging theft of 23GB of sensitive data including financial records and employee PII.
