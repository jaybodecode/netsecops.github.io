The 'Telecommunications (Telecom Cyber Security) Amendment Rules, 2025' introduce two key measures: the establishment of a centralized Mobile Number Validation (MNV) platform to secure digital communications, and stricter controls on International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers. The new IMEI rules prohibit the assignment of already-used IMEIs to new devices and mandate that sellers and buyers of used devices verify the IMEI against a national database to combat theft and tampering.","## Executive Summary\nThe government of **[India](https://www.india.gov.in/)** has officially implemented the Telecommunications (Telecom Cyber Security) Amendment Rules, 2025, which came into force on October 22, 2025. These new regulations are designed to bolster the security of the nation's telecom networks and protect consumers from fraud and cyber threats. The amendment introduces two primary components: the creation of a central Mobile Number Validation (MNV) platform to enhance security across telecom services, and a comprehensive framework for managing International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers. This IMEI framework aims to curb the use of stolen, cloned, or tampered mobile devices by creating a national database and placing new obligations on manufacturers, importers, and resellers.\n\n---\n\n## Regulatory Details\nThe amendment modifies the 2024 Telecom Cyber Security rules, introducing specific, actionable requirements for the telecom ecosystem.\n\n### Mobile Number Validation (MNV) Platform\n- The central government is now empowered to establish and mandate participation in a centralized MNV platform.\n- All telecom licensees and other authorized entities can be directed to integrate with this platform.\n- **Objective:** To create a unified system for validating mobile numbers, preventing security incidents, and ensuring a more trusted communication environment.\n\n### IMEI Number Controls\n- **Prohibition on Reuse:** Manufacturers and importers are now forbidden from assigning an IMEI number to a new device if that IMEI is already active on an Indian telecom network.\n- **National IMEI Database:** The government will create and maintain a national database of tampered, cloned, or otherwise restricted IMEI numbers (a blacklist).\n- **Mandatory Verification for Resale:** Any individual or entity selling or purchasing a used mobile device **must** first verify its IMEI against the government's database. The transaction cannot proceed if the device is on the restricted list.\n\n## Affected Organizations\nThese rules impact a wide range of entities operating within India's telecommunications market:\n- **Telecom Licensees:** Mobile network operators (e.g., Jio, Airtel, Vodafone Idea).\n- **Device Manufacturers:** Companies like Samsung, Apple, Xiaomi, and others that manufacture or assemble devices for the Indian market.\n- **Importers:** Businesses that import mobile devices into India.\n- **Resellers and Second-hand Markets:** Formal and informal sellers of used mobile phones.\n- **Consumers:** Individuals buying and selling used devices.\n\n## Compliance Requirements\n- **Telecom Operators:** Must integrate with the forthcoming MNV platform as directed by the government.\n- **Manufacturers/Importers:** Must implement processes to ensure they do not duplicate IMEI numbers already present in the Indian network ecosystem.\n- **Sellers/Buyers of Used Devices:** Must adopt a new step in their transaction process: querying the national IMEI database before finalizing a sale. This will likely require an accessible government portal or API.\n\n## Implementation Timeline\n- The rules came into force on **October 22, 2025**.\n- The establishment of the MNV platform and the national IMEI database will be directed by the central government, with specific timelines for integration to be announced.\n\n## Impact Assessment\n- **For Consumers:** The rules aim to provide greater protection against purchasing stolen or fraudulent devices. It adds a layer of due diligence to the second-hand market.\n- **For Industry:** Manufacturers and resellers will face new compliance burdens. They will need to adapt their supply chain and sales processes to incorporate IMEI validation. This could increase operational costs but will also help sanitize the market of illicit devices.\n- **For Law Enforcement:** The national IMEI database will be a powerful tool for tracking stolen devices and combating mobile-related crime.\n\nOverall, the regulations represent a significant step by the Indian government to tighten control over its telecom infrastructure and address the security challenges posed by a massive and growing mobile user base.","🇮🇳 India rolls out new telecom cybersecurity rules.
