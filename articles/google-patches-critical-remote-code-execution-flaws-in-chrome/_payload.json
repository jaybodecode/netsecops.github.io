Three are high-severity flaws (CVE-2025-12725, CVE-2025-12726, CVE-2025-12727), each with a CVSS score of 8.8, that could lead to remote code execution. The most critical is an out-of-bounds write in the WebGPU component. Users are urged to update immediately.","## Executive Summary\n**[Google](https://www.google.com)** has released an emergency security update for its **[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)** web browser, addressing five vulnerabilities, three of which are rated high-severity and could lead to remote code execution (RCE). The update is being rolled out for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android users. The most critical vulnerability, **`CVE-2025-12725`**, is an out-of-bounds write flaw in the **[WebGPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGPU)** component that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by tricking a user into visiting a malicious website. While Google is not aware of any active exploits for these vulnerabilities in the wild, the severity of the flaws necessitates immediate action. All Chrome users are strongly advised to update their browsers to the latest version to mitigate the risk of potential exploitation.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\nThe security update addresses a total of five vulnerabilities. The three high-severity flaws are:\n\n*   **`CVE-2025-12725` (CVSS 8.8):** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability in Chrome's WebGPU implementation. A remote attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious HTML page. Successful exploitation could lead to memory corruption, a browser crash, or arbitrary code execution in the context of the sandboxed renderer process.\n*   **`CVE-2025-12726` (CVSS 8.8):** An inappropriate implementation vulnerability in the Views component, which is responsible for UI elements. This flaw could also be exploited for memory corruption and potential code execution.\n*   **`CVE-2025-12727` (CVSS 8.8):** An inappropriate implementation in the **[V8](https://v8.dev/)** JavaScript and WebAssembly engine. Exploitation could lead to a sandbox escape when chained with other vulnerabilities.\n\nTwo medium-severity vulnerabilities were also patched:\n*   **`CVE-2025-12728` (CVSS 6.5):** A flaw in the Omnibox address bar.\n*   **`CVE-2025-12729` (CVSS 6.5):** Another flaw in the Omnibox address bar.\n\n---\n\n## Affected Systems\n*   **Google Chrome for Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux):** Versions prior to `142.0.7444.134` and `142.0.7444.135`.\n*   **Google Chrome for Android:** Versions prior to `142.0.7444.138`.\n\nUsers can check their Chrome version by navigating to `chrome://settings/help`.\n\n---\n\n## Exploitation Status\nAs of November 7, 2025, Google stated that it is not aware of any in-the-wild exploitation of these vulnerabilities. However, high-severity browser vulnerabilities, especially those leading to RCE, are prime targets for exploit developers and threat actors. The public disclosure of these flaws increases the likelihood of exploitation attempts in the near future.\n\n---\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe primary risk associated with these vulnerabilities is remote code execution. An attacker could host a malicious website and, upon a user visiting it, execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. While Chrome's sandbox provides a layer of protection, attackers often chain browser exploits with sandbox escape vulnerabilities to gain full control over the underlying operating system. A successful attack could lead to the installation of malware, ransomware, or spyware, resulting in data theft, financial loss, or complete system compromise.\n\n---\n\n## Detection Methods\n*   **Version Scanning:** The most reliable method of detection is to identify systems running vulnerable versions of Google Chrome. Asset management systems and vulnerability scanners can be used to query for Chrome versions across the enterprise.\n*   **Endpoint Monitoring:** Monitor for unexpected crashes of the `chrome.exe` process or the spawning of suspicious child processes (e.g., `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`) from a Chrome process, which could indicate successful exploitation.\n\n---\n\n## Remediation Steps\n*   **Update Immediately ([`M1051 - Update Software`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1051/)):** The only way to remediate these vulnerabilities is to update Google Chrome to the latest version. Chrome typically updates automatically, but users should manually trigger the update by going to `Help > About Google Chrome` to ensure it is applied promptly. This corresponds to D3FEND's [`D3-SU: Software Update`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SoftwareUpdate).\n*   **Restart the Browser:** The update will not take full effect until the browser is restarted.\n*   **Enterprise Patch Management:** System administrators should use enterprise management tools to push the updated version of Chrome to all managed devices.","📢 URGENT: Google patches multiple high-severity RCE flaws in Chrome!

Given the potential for remote code execution, this should be treated as a critical action. System administrators must use their endpoint management tools (e.g., Microsoft Intune, Jamf, Google Workspace) to push the update to Chrome version 142.0.7444.134/135 (desktop) or 142.0.7444.138 (Android) to all devices. A policy should be configured to force a browser restart within a short timeframe (e.g., 2-8 hours) to ensure the patch is applied, as Chrome's updates are not fully active until a restart occurs. Compliance reports should be run within 24 hours to identify and remediate any devices that have failed to update. For unmanaged devices, a clear communication campaign should be sent to all users instructing them to manually check for updates via 'Help > About Google Chrome' and restart their browser.",{"technique_id":96,"technique_name":97,"url":98,"recommendation":142,"mitre_mitigation_id":88},"While patching is paramount, organizations can further harden their browser environment to mitigate the risk from future zero-days. This involves configuring browser policies to reduce the attack surface. For these specific vulnerabilities in WebGPU and V8, administrators can use Group Policy or MDM settings to disable features that are non-essential for business operations. For example, if WebGPU is not used by any corporate applications, its use can be restricted or disabled via the `WebGPUEnabled` policy. Similarly, disabling the JIT compiler in V8 (`V8JavascriptJitEnabled` policy) can make certain exploits harder to execute, though this may come with a performance penalty. Implementing browser security extensions that block scripts from untrusted sources (e.g., uBlock Origin, NoScript) can also prevent the initial exploit code from running. These hardening measures act as a valuable compensating control, especially in the critical window before a patch is widely deployed.",[],[145,150],{"type":146,"value":147,"description":148,"context":149,"confidence":43},"process_name","chrome.exe","Monitor for chrome.exe processes that crash unexpectedly or spawn suspicious child processes like cmd.exe or powershell.exe, which could indicate successful exploitation.","Windows Event ID 4688 (Process Creation), EDR logs.",{"type":151,"value":152,"description":153,"context":154,"confidence":15},"other","Chrome version \u003C 142.0.7444.134","Any desktop instance of Google Chrome with a version number lower than 142.0.7444.134 is vulnerable and should be prioritized for patching.","Asset inventory systems, vulnerability scanners.",[156,157,13,26,158,159],"Google Chrome","RCE","V8 Engine","Browser Security","2025-11-08T15:00:00.000Z","TechArticle",{"geographic_scope":163,"other_affected":164},"global",[165],"Google Chrome users","2025-11-08",4,{"articles":169,"totalCount":5233,"lastUpdated":5234},[170,192,210,227,240,255,271,284,296,310,324,337,349,366,378,392,406,418,430,445,460,477,492,505,518,531,546,560,571,584,600,612,624,637,647,659,669,685,699,712,726,740,752,768,781,794,807,821,836,850,864,877,890,902,917,931,941,954,968,982,997,1013,1026,1038,1055,1068,1078,1093,1104,1118,1129,1139,1151,1163,1176,1186,1198,1211,1225,1236,1252,1265,1277,1288,1301,1314,1326,1340,1349,1360,1372,1386,1395,1409,1421,1433,1444,1455,1466,1478,1492,1504,1517,1531,1544,1555,1566,1578,1591,1603,1614,1627,1640,1653,1666,1678,1691,1705,1716,1728,1741,1755,1769,1779,1792,1803,1817,1833,1844,1857,1872,1883,1893,1905,1917,1929,1939,1951,1964,1977,1987,2000,2012,2024,2033,2045,2060,2071,2080,2093,2103,2111,2120,2131,2141,2154,2164,2173,2183,2194,2206,2219,2228,2239,2249,2258,2269,2279,2292,2303,2315,2328,2341,2353,2368,2379,2390,2406,2419,2430,2440,2452,2464,2478,2491,2506,2520,2534,2547,2559,2572,2584,2596,2606,2616,2627,2639,2651,2662,2671,2682,2691,2703,2716,2727,2741,2752,2762,2774,2785,2796,2804,2816,2829,2837,2848,2861,2871,2881,2892,2906,2916,2928,2939,2951,2961,2973,2984,2994,3005,3015,3025,3035,3043,3052,3066,3077,3085,3095,3103,3112,3122,3136,3146,3155,3168,3179,3194,3205,3215,3227,3237,3249,3261,3272,3282,3293,3302,3313,3325,3337,3349,3358,3369,3379,3390,3401,3414,3430,3440,3450,3460,3472,3485,3496,3509,3519,3529,3539,3548,3560,3572,3585,3597,3607,3618,3630,3642,3652,3663,3674,3685,3699,3710,3720,3731,3741,3751,3761,3774,3783,3794,3808,3818,3831,3839,3850,3860,3870,3879,3889,3901,3914,3927,3938,3952,3963,3972,3982,3991,3999,4009,4023,4035,4046,4055,4065,4076,4087,4099,4110,4123,4134,4148,4159,4173,4186,4198,4207,4218,4228,4237,4248,4259,4271,4282,4292,4306,4317,4329,4339,4352,4363,4377,4388,4399,4410,4419,4429,4439,4449,4458,4467,4479,4491,4503,4512,4524,4535,4546,4555,4565,4575,4585,4595,4606,4617,4627,4636,4646,4656,4668,4679,4689,4699,4707,4718,4728,4738,4751,4761,4771,4781,4791,4802,4813,4825,4837,4849,4859,4870,4882,4892,4903,4913,4923,4933,4941,4951,4963,4976,4986,4998,5008,5019,5028,5037,5046,5055,5064,5073,5082,5091,5100,5110,5120,5128,5137,5146,5156,5165,5176,5186,5197,5205,5214,5223],{"id":171,"slug":172,"headline":173,"title":174,"severity":15,"article_type":175,"excerpt":176,"tags":177,"categories":186,"createdAt":188,"updatedAt":188,"displayDate":189,"isUpdated":190,"readingTime":191},"c3f9d6a8-43cb-44e6-9d47-07c5600788cc","soundcloud-and-pornhub-disclose-user-data-breaches","SoundCloud and Pornhub Confirm User Data Exposure in Separate Breaches, One Via Third-Party","SoundCloud and Pornhub Disclose Data Breaches; Pornhub Incident Linked to Third-Party Vendor Mixpanel","NewsArticle","Both SoundCloud and Pornhub have confirmed security incidents exposing user data.
