The DragonForce group was the second most active with three victims. The attacks primarily targeted the professional services and manufacturing sectors, with victims located in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. This latest surge brings the total number of publicly claimed ransomware victims in 2025 to 6,364, underscoring the relentless and persistent threat that ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations pose to organizations globally.","## Executive Summary\nThe ransomware landscape remains highly active, with the **[Qilin](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/qilin)** ransomware group demonstrating a significant operational tempo on November 8, 2025. The group claimed seven of the eleven new victims posted on data leak sites in a 24-hour period, marking it as the most prolific operator during this time. The attacks show a continued focus on the professional services and manufacturing sectors, likely due to the sensitive data they hold and their perceived willingness to pay. Geographically, the victims were concentrated in the **[United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)**, Canada, and the United Kingdom. This activity is part of a sustained, high-volume campaign by multiple ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups that continues to threaten organizations worldwide.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\nOn November 8, 2025, the following ransomware groups reported new victims:\n- **Qilin:** 7 victims\n- **DragonForce:** 3 victims\n- **Securotop:** 1 victim\n\nThis distribution highlights the dominance of the **Qilin** operation in the current threat landscape. The group operates a RaaS model, providing its malware and infrastructure to affiliates who carry out the attacks in exchange for a share of the profits. This model allows for a high volume of attacks against a diverse set of targets.\n\nThe primary targets remain:\n- **Professional Services:** Including legal, accounting, and consulting firms that hold sensitive client data.\n- **Manufacturing:** Where operational downtime caused by encryption can lead to massive financial losses, increasing the pressure to pay a ransom.\n\nThe total number of victims for 2025 has now reached 6,364, indicating that ransomware activity has not diminished despite law enforcement actions against some groups.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nQilin, like many modern RaaS operations, employs a double-extortion strategy. Their typical attack chain involves:\n1.  **Initial Access:** Affiliates often gain access through phishing emails ([`T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/)), exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in public-facing services like VPNs and RDP ([`T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/)), or purchasing access from initial access brokers.\n2.  **Reconnaissance and Lateral Movement:** Once inside, they use tools like Cobalt Strike and legitimate system utilities to map the network, escalate privileges, and move laterally to identify and access high-value data repositories and domain controllers ([`T1021.001 - Remote Desktop Protocol`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001/)).\n3.  **Data Exfiltration:** Before deploying the encryptor, they exfiltrate large volumes of sensitive data to cloud storage under their control ([`T1567.002 - Exfiltration to Cloud Storage`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/002/)). This data is used as leverage for payment.\n4.  **Impact:** Finally, they deploy the Qilin ransomware payload across the network, encrypting servers and workstations to disrupt business operations ([`T1486 - Data Encrypted for Impact`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/)).\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe impact of a Qilin ransomware attack is severe. Victims face a multi-faceted crisis:\n- **Business Disruption:** Encryption of critical systems can halt all operations for days or weeks.\n- **Financial Costs:** These include the ransom demand itself, costs for forensic investigation, system restoration, and legal counsel.\n- **Data Breach:** The exfiltration of data triggers regulatory obligations and can lead to significant fines, lawsuits, and loss of customer trust.\n- **Reputational Damage:** Being named on a public data leak site damages the organization's brand and reputation.\n\nFor professional services firms, the breach of client confidentiality can be catastrophic, potentially leading to the loss of major clients and a collapse of the business.\n\n## Detection & Response\nEarly detection is key to preventing widespread encryption.\n\n1.  **EDR/XDR Alerts:** Monitor for common ransomware precursors, such as the use of tools like `Mimikatz` for credential dumping, disabling of security software, and deletion of volume shadow copies (`vssadmin`). These are strong signals of an active intrusion. [`D3-PA: Process Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ProcessAnalysis) is essential for this.\n2.  **Network Data Exfiltration:** Use NTA and DLP tools to monitor for and alert on large, anomalous outbound data flows. A sudden upload of gigabytes of data to a cloud service from a file server is a major red flag. This involves [`D3-UDTA: User Data Transfer Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:UserDataTransferAnalysis).\n3.  **Active Directory Monitoring:** Monitor for unusual activity in Active Directory, such as the creation of new administrative accounts, privilege escalation, and changes to group policies. [`D3-DAM: Domain Account Monitoring`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:DomainAccountMonitoring) can provide early warnings.\n\n## Mitigation\nA multi-layered, defense-in-depth approach is required to defend against ransomware.\n\n1.  **Immutable Backups:** This is the most critical defense. Maintain offline (air-gapped) or immutable backups of all critical data and systems. Regularly test the restoration process to ensure you can recover without paying the ransom.\n2.  **Patch Management:** Promptly patch all internet-facing systems and software to close the vulnerabilities that ransomware affiliates commonly exploit. This is a fundamental aspect of [`D3-SU: Software Update`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SoftwareUpdate).\n3.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA on all remote access points (VPN, RDP), email accounts, and privileged accounts. This mitigates the risk of stolen credentials being used for initial access.\n4.  **Network Segmentation:** Segment your network to limit an attacker's ability to move laterally. A flat network allows ransomware to spread unimpeded. Isolate critical assets in secure zones.","🚨 Ransomware activity spikes as the Qilin gang claims 7 new victims in 24 hours.

By using technologies like Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for databases and full-disk encryption (e.g., BitLocker) for servers, the data remains encrypted even if an attacker manages to exfiltrate the raw files. This must be combined with strong access controls and key management. If Qilin exfiltrates an encrypted database file but does not have the decryption key, the data is useless to them, neutralizing the extortion threat. This strategy shifts the focus from preventing the breach entirely (which is difficult) to making the stolen data worthless, thereby reducing the attacker's leverage.","M1041",{"technique_id":115,"technique_name":116,"url":117,"recommendation":118,"mitre_mitigation_id":119},"D3-UDTA","User Data Transfer Analysis","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:UserDataTransferAnalysis","To detect the data exfiltration stage of a Qilin attack, organizations must implement User Data Transfer Analysis. This involves using a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) or Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) solution to monitor and baseline the volume and type of data leaving the network. Security teams should create specific rules to alert on large transfers of data, especially compressed files (`.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`), to untrusted or consumer-grade cloud storage providers (e.g., Mega, Dropbox, Google Drive). An alert should be triggered if, for example, a server that normally sends minimal outbound traffic suddenly uploads 100GB of data. This provides a high-confidence indicator of an active breach and may give the security team a chance to intervene and terminate the connection before the exfiltration is complete and the encryption begins.","M1040",{"technique_id":121,"technique_name":122,"url":123,"recommendation":124,"mitre_mitigation_id":125},"D3-PA","Process Analysis","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ProcessAnalysis","Detecting ransomware precursors requires deep Process Analysis via an EDR tool.

These commands are almost exclusively used for malicious purposes to hinder recovery and cover tracks.
