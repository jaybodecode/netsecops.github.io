The industrial sector has emerged as the most targeted industry, accounting for over 36% of attacks analyzed between April and September 2025. The research highlights the dominance of PowerShell as a key attack tool, used in nearly 78% of ransomware campaigns. The United States remains the most targeted nation, and the ransomware landscape is highly fragmented, with the top five groups accounting for less than 40% of all incidents.","## Executive Summary\nA new CyberThreat Report from **[Trellix](https://www.trellix.com/)** for October 2025 indicates a blurring of lines between nation-state espionage and financially motivated cybercrime. Threat actors of all motivations are adopting similar, more sophisticated tactics, including the use of AI-powered malware, to increase the speed and scale of their attacks. The report, analyzing data from April to September 2025, identifies the industrial sector as the most heavily targeted, suffering 36.57% of all sector-based attacks. The research also confirms trends seen elsewhere: the **[United States](https://www.cisa.gov)** is the most-attacked country, and the ransomware ecosystem is highly fragmented. A key technical finding is the overwhelming dominance of **[PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/)** as a tool in ransomware campaigns, featuring in over 77% of attacks.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe convergence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) between state-sponsored groups and e-crime syndicates makes attribution more difficult and raises the overall threat level for all organizations. Nation-state actors may engage in financially motivated attacks to fund their operations, while criminal groups adopt stealthy, persistent techniques traditionally associated with espionage.\n\n**Key Trends:**\n- **Targeting:** The industrial sector is the primary target (890 incidents), indicating a focus on critical infrastructure and manufacturing where disruption has high value.\n- **Geography:** The U.S. is the epicenter of attacks, with 1,285 victims (55% of total).\n- **Ransomware Fragmentation:** The market is not dominated by a single group. The top five gangs, including **Qilin**, are responsible for less than 40% of attacks, indicating a diverse and competitive criminal ecosystem.\n- **AI in Attacks:** The report notes the emergence of AI-powered malware, suggesting attackers are using AI for tasks like crafting more convincing phishing emails, identifying vulnerabilities, or creating polymorphic malware that evades signature-based detection.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThe report provides specific data on the tools used in ransomware campaigns, highlighting the prevalence of \"Living off the Land\" techniques.\n- **Execution:** [`T1059.001 - PowerShell`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/) was the tool of choice in 77.7% of campaigns for script execution and payload delivery.\n- **Lateral Movement:** [`T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570/) using **[PsExec](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0029/)** was observed in 66.5% of attacks to move between systems.\n- **Discovery:** SoftPerfect Network Scanner was used for network reconnaissance in 54.2% of cases.\n- **Command Execution:** Standard `net` commands were used in 70.2% of attacks for tasks like user creation and privilege checks.\n\nThis data reinforces the need for defenders to focus on monitoring the usage of legitimate system tools, not just looking for known malware.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe focus on the industrial sector is particularly concerning due to the potential for physical consequences. A successful attack on an industrial control system (ICS) environment could lead to production shutdowns, equipment damage, environmental incidents, or even risks to human safety. The convergence of espionage and financial crime means that an attack that initially appears to be financially motivated could have a secondary objective of stealing intellectual property or establishing long-term persistence for future disruption.\n\n## Detection & Response\n- **Behavioral Monitoring:** Given the heavy use of legitimate tools, detection must be behavior-based. Monitor for chains of activity, such as a PowerShell script leading to the use of PsExec, followed by network scanning. This is where **[D3FEND User Behavior Analysis](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:UserBehaviorAnalysis)** becomes critical.\n- **PowerShell Logging:** Enable and ingest PowerShell Script Block Logging (Event ID 4104) and Module Logging (Event ID 4103). This provides deep visibility into PowerShell activity, even for obfuscated or fileless attacks.\n- **Threat Hunting:** Proactively hunt for the use of tools like PsExec and SoftPerfect Network Scanner in your environment. Establish baselines for legitimate administrative use and investigate any deviations.\n\n## Mitigation\n1.  **Harden PowerShell:** Use application control (e.g., AppLocker) to restrict PowerShell usage. Enforce a `Constrained Language Mode` for regular users, which limits access to dangerous commands, while allowing full access for administrators.\n2.  **Secure Privileged Accounts:** Strictly control access to administrative accounts. Implement Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions to vault credentials and monitor privileged sessions.\n3.  **Network Segmentation:** For the industrial sector, robust segmentation between the IT and OT (Operational Technology) networks is non-negotiable. Use a DMZ to broker all communication and prevent direct access from the less-secure IT environment to the critical OT environment.\n4.  **Layered Security:** Implement a defense-in-depth strategy that includes endpoint protection (EPP), endpoint detection and response (EDR), network security, and robust backup and recovery systems.","Trellix report: Lines blur between nation-state & financial cybercrime. 🚨 Industrial sector is now the #1 target.

Cybersecurity firm MailGuard intercepted the scam on February 9, 2026, which uses emails with the subject line \"Parcel Awaiting Instructions.\" The emails claim a delivery has failed due to an incomplete address and trick recipients into clicking a link to pay a small, fraudulent shipping fee of 1.99 AUD. The link leads to a sophisticated, multi-stage credential harvesting site designed to look like an official Australia Post portal. The site first captures the victim's full credit card details and phone number, and then, in a final crucial step, prompts for the one-time passcode (OTP) sent to their mobile. This allows the attackers to authorize fraudulent transactions immediately.
