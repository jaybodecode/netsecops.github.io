The company admitted that customer PII, contact details, and bank account IBANs were potentially exposed. The situation is amplified by a threat actor on a cybercrime forum who claims to have stolen a 1.05 TB database containing the data of over 20 million people, which is now up for sale. Endesa, which serves over 10 million customers, is urging vigilance against phishing and fraud.","## Executive Summary\n**[Endesa](https://www.endesa.com/)**, Spain's largest energy provider and a subsidiary of the **Enel Group**, has acknowledged a significant data breach affecting its customers. The company detected unauthorized access to one of its commercial platforms, resulting in the exposure of sensitive customer information. Exposed data includes names, contact details, national ID numbers (DNI), and, critically, bank account IBANs. While Endesa has sought to downplay the risk, a threat actor has surfaced on a prominent cybercrime forum claiming to have exfiltrated a 1.05 terabyte SQL database containing records for over 20 million individuals. This massive discrepancy between the corporate disclosure and the cybercriminal's claim suggests the breach could be far more severe than initially reported, placing millions of individuals at high risk of financial fraud and identity theft.\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe incident involves two conflicting narratives. Endesa's official statement confirms a breach of its `Energía XXI` commercial platform, admitting that attackers accessed and potentially exfiltrated customer identification, contact, and contract data. Most concerning is the admission that bank account IBANs were part of the exposed dataset. The company has asserted that account passwords were not compromised.\n\nIn stark contrast, a threat actor using the alias \"Spain\" has posted the data for sale on a hacking forum. The actor claims the stolen dataset is a 1.05 TB SQL database containing \"fresh data\" on over 20 million people, which they are offering to a single buyer. This suggests a complete compromise of a major customer database, not just limited access.\n\nEndesa has notified Spain's Data Protection Agency (**AEPD**) and is urging customers to be cautious of phishing emails, smishing attacks, and other fraudulent communications that may leverage the stolen data.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThe exact vector of the breach has not been disclosed, but the nature of the stolen data (a full SQL database) points towards several likely scenarios:\n1.  **Web Application Vulnerability:** A flaw such as SQL Injection ([`T1190`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/)) on the public-facing commercial platform could have allowed the attacker to bypass authentication and dump the entire backend database.\n2.  **Compromised Credentials:** Stolen credentials for a developer or database administrator could have provided direct access to the database.\n3.  **Misconfigured Cloud Storage:** The SQL database could have been stored in a misconfigured cloud bucket or server, left publicly accessible without proper authentication.\n\nOnce access was gained, the attacker likely used automated tools to exfiltrate the large volume of data ([`T1020`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1020/)) over an extended period to avoid detection, before putting it up for sale on the dark web.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe potential impact of this breach is massive, especially if the hacker's claims are accurate:\n- **Financial Fraud:** The exposure of IBANs alongside names and national ID numbers creates a significant risk of fraudulent bank transfers and direct debit scams.\n- **Widespread Phishing:** Attackers can use the stolen data to craft highly convincing and personalized phishing campaigns, targeting millions of Endesa customers to steal further information or deploy malware.\n- **Identity Theft:** With names, contact details, and DNI numbers, criminals have the core components needed to perpetrate identity theft.\n- **Regulatory Fines:** Endesa faces the prospect of substantial fines under GDPR for failing to adequately protect customer data, especially sensitive financial information.\n- **Loss of Customer Trust:** As a provider of critical infrastructure, this breach severely undermines public trust in Endesa's ability to secure its systems and customer data.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n- **Database Activity Monitoring:** Monitor for unusual, large-scale query activity, especially `SELECT *` commands or queries that export large numbers of rows from customer data tables.\n- **Network Egress Traffic:** Look for anomalous large data transfers from database servers to unknown external IP addresses. This is a key indicator of data exfiltration.\n- **Log Analysis:** Scrutinize web server and application logs for signs of SQL injection attacks, authentication failures, or unauthorized access from unusual geolocations.\n\n## Detection & Response\n- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** DLP solutions can be configured to detect and block the exfiltration of structured data formats like DNI numbers and IBANs.\n- **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA):** UEBA systems can help detect compromised accounts by flagging deviations from normal user behavior, such as a developer account suddenly accessing and downloading an entire customer database.\n- **Threat Intelligence:** Monitor dark web forums and marketplaces for mentions of your company or stolen data. Early detection of a data sale can provide a crucial head start in the incident response process.\n\n## Mitigation\n1.  **Web Application Security:** Regularly scan and penetration test all public-facing applications for vulnerabilities like SQL injection and enforce secure coding practices. This aligns with D3FEND's [`D3-ACH: Application Configuration Hardening`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ApplicationConfigurationHardening).\n2.  **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data, both at rest and in transit, must be encrypted. While this wouldn't have stopped a breach via a valid application query, encrypting PII within the database itself ([`D3-FE: File Encryption`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:FileEncryption)) can add another layer of protection.\n3.  **Access Control:** Implement the principle of least privilege for all accounts, especially those with access to sensitive databases. Database access should be tightly restricted to a small number of authorized personnel and applications.\n4.  **Customer Communication:** Proactively and transparently communicate with affected customers, providing clear guidance on how to protect themselves and how to report suspicious activity.","Spanish energy giant Endesa confirms a major data breach. ⚡️ While the company is notifying

Configure alerts to trigger when data transfer volumes drastically exceed this baseline, especially if the destination is an external or unauthorized IP address.

For a platform like Energía XXI, this means ensuring all user-supplied input is strictly validated and parameterized queries are used to interact with the SQL database. Furthermore, hardening involves removing unnecessary features, setting secure configuration flags, and ensuring error messages do not leak sensitive system information. This proactive measure aims to eliminate the initial entry point that attackers exploit to gain access to backend data.","M1054",{"technique_id":139,"technique_name":140,"url":141,"recommendation":142,"mitre_mitigation_id":143},"D3-UAP","User Account Permissions","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:UserAccountPermissions","The principle of least privilege must be strictly enforced for all accounts that can access the customer database.

By restricting permissions, you ensure that even if an attacker compromises a service or user account, the potential damage is contained. They might be able to access one record, but not exfiltrate the data of 20 million customers in one
