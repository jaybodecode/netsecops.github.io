A critical SQL injection flaw (CVE-2026-1179) affects Yonyou KSOA 9.0. A critical command injection vulnerability (CVE-2026-1192) was found in Tosei Online Store Management System 1.01. Additionally, a high-severity improper authorization bug (CVE-2026-1193) impacts MineAdmin. Since vendors reportedly did not respond before disclosure, users of these products are urged to apply immediate mitigations to prevent compromise.","## Executive Summary\n\nSecurity researchers have disclosed three significant vulnerabilities in various business management software suites, and have released public proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits for each. The lack of vendor response prior to disclosure creates a critical risk window for organizations using the affected products. The flaws include a **critical** SQL injection in **[Yonyou](https://www.yonyou.com/)** KSOA, a **critical** command injection in Tosei Online Store Management System, and a **high-severity** improper authorization in MineAdmin. The availability of public exploits means that even low-skilled attackers can now attempt to compromise vulnerable systems. Administrators of these products must take immediate action to mitigate these risks, even in the absence of official patches.\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n\n### CVE-2026-1179: Yonyou KSOA SQL Injection\n*   **CVE ID**: **[CVE-2026-1179](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1179)**\n*   **Severity**: Critical\n*   **Affected Product**: Yonyou KSOA 9.0\n*   **Description**: A remote, unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/kmf/user_popedom.jsp` file. An attacker can manipulate the `folderid` argument in a request to this endpoint to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the backend database. This could lead to data exfiltration, modification, or complete database takeover.\n\n### CVE-2026-1192: Tosei Online Store Management System Command Injection\n*   **CVE ID**: **[CVE-2026-1192](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1192)**\n*   **Severity**: Critical\n*   **Affected Product**: Tosei Online Store Management System 1.01\n*   **Description**: A remote command injection vulnerability exists in the `/cgi-bin/imode_alldata.php` file. By manipulating the `DevId` argument, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server with the privileges of the web service. This can lead to a full system compromise.\n\n### CVE-2026-1193: MineAdmin Improper Authorization\n*   **CVE ID**: **[CVE-2026-1193](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1193)**\n*   **Severity**: High\n*   **Affected Product**: MineAdmin 1.x and 2.x\n*   **Description**: An improper authorization vulnerability in the `/system/cache/view` file of the View Interface component allows a remote attacker to access resources or perform actions they should not be able to. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure or unauthorized state changes in the application.\n\n## Exploitation Status\n\n**Public exploits are available for all three vulnerabilities.** This dramatically lowers the bar for exploitation and means that automated scanning and mass exploitation attempts are imminent, if not already underway. The lack of vendor patches makes this a zero-day situation for users.\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\nThe impact varies by vulnerability, but all are severe:\n*   **CVE-2026-1179 (SQLi)**: Could lead to the theft of all data stored by the KSOA application, including user credentials, financial records, and proprietary business data.\n*   **CVE-2026-1192 (RCE)**: The most severe impact, as it allows for full remote code execution. An attacker can take complete control of the underlying server, install malware (like ransomware), and use it as a pivot point to attack the internal network.\n*   **CVE-2026-1193 (Auth Bypass)**: Could allow an attacker to access sensitive information or perform administrative actions, potentially leading to account takeovers or further exploitation.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n\nSecurity teams should hunt for exploitation attempts in web server logs:\n\n| Type | Value | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| URL Pattern | `*/kmf/user_popedom.jsp*folderid=*` | Look for requests to this Yonyou KSOA endpoint containing SQL syntax or sleep commands. |\n| URL Pattern | `*/cgi-bin/imode_alldata.php*DevId=*` | Look for requests to this Tosei endpoint containing shell metacharacters like `;`, `|`, `&`, or commands like `whoami`, `id`. |\n| URL Pattern | `*/system/cache/view*` | Monitor for unauthorized access attempts to this MineAdmin endpoint from external IPs. |\n\n## Detection Methods\n\n*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Deploy a WAF with rulesets designed to block SQL injection and command injection attacks. This is the most effective immediate detection and prevention method. This is a form of **D3FEND's** [`Inbound Traffic Filtering`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:InboundTrafficFiltering).\n*   **Log Analysis**: Actively monitor web server access logs for the URL patterns listed above. Create SIEM alerts for any matches.\n*   **EDR**: On the web servers, monitor for suspicious processes being spawned by the web server process (e.g., `w3wp.exe`, `httpd`, `nginx`), which would be a strong indicator of successful command injection.\n\n## Remediation Steps\n\nIn the absence of official patches, mitigation relies on compensating controls.\n\n1.  **Deploy a WAF (Immediate Priority)**: If you do not have a WAF in front of these applications, deploy one immediately. Use it to create virtual patches that specifically block requests matching the malicious patterns for these CVEs.\n2.  **Restrict Access**: If possible, restrict access to these applications to trusted IP addresses only. If the application must be public-facing, place it behind a VPN or other authenticated gateway.\n3.  **Isolate the Application**: Ensure the application server is on a segmented network to limit the blast radius if it is compromised. It should not be able to communicate freely with domain controllers or databases on other networks.\n4.  **Monitor and Hunt**: Continuously monitor logs for signs of attempted or successful exploitation. If a compromise is suspected, take the server offline immediately and begin incident response procedures.","🚨 CRITICAL VULNS with PUBLIC EXPLOITS: SQL injection in Yonyou KSOA (CVE-2026-1179), command injection in Tosei (CVE-2026-1192), and auth flaw in MineAdmin (CVE-2026-1193).

A WAF should be deployed in front of the vulnerable Yonyou, Tosei, and MineAdmin applications. Configure the WAF with core rulesets to block generic SQL injection and command injection patterns. More importantly, create specific 'virtual patching' rules to block requests to the exact vulnerable endpoints: `/kmf/user_popedom.jsp` for Yonyou and `/cgi-bin/imode_alldata.php` for Tosei. The rules should be configured to inspect the `folderid` and `DevId` parameters, respectively, and drop any request containing suspicious characters (`'`, `;`, `|`, `wget`, `curl`).

A successful exploit will result in the web server process (e.g., `httpd`, `nginx`, `w3wp.exe`) spawning an anomalous child process, such as a shell (`/bin/sh`, `cmd.exe`) or a script interpreter (`powershell.exe`, `python`). Configure your EDR or host-based intrusion detection system to specifically alert on this parent-child process relationship. This is a very high-fidelity indicator of a web-based RCE. Establish a baseline of normal child processes for your web server and alert on any deviation. In the event of an alert, the host should be immediately isolated from the network to prevent further actions by the attacker, such as downloading additional malware or beginning lateral movement.","M1049",[],[121,126,129,132],{"type":122,"value":123,"description":124,"context":125,"confidence":35},"url_pattern","/kmf/user_popedom.jsp","Vulnerable endpoint in Yonyou KSOA.
