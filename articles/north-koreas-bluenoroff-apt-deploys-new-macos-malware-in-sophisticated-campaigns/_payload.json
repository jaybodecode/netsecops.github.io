According to Kaspersky, the financially motivated group, a subset of the Lazarus Group, is targeting venture capitalists and Web3 developers with fake Zoom and Microsoft Teams clients, AI-enhanced social engineering, and a new suite of malware designed to steal cryptocurrency. Victims have been identified globally, including in Japan, Italy, France, and Singapore.","## Executive Summary\n**[BlueNoroff](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0063/)** (also known as APT38 or Sapphire Sleet), the financially motivated subgroup of North Korea's infamous **[Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032/)**, has launched two new, highly sophisticated campaigns named 'GhostCall' and 'GhostHire'. Research from **[Kaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.com)** reveals these operations deploy a new arsenal of malware targeting **macOS** systems, a departure from the group's more frequent focus on Windows. The campaigns, active since at least April 2025, use elaborate social engineering lures—including fake job offers and investment opportunities enhanced with AI—to compromise executives in venture capital and developers in the Web3 and cryptocurrency industries. The ultimate goal is the theft of cryptocurrency assets.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe two campaigns are part of BlueNoroff's broader 'SnatchCrypto' operation and demonstrate the group's increasing sophistication and focus on high-value targets in the financial and tech sectors.\n\n-   **GhostCall Campaign:** Attackers pose as investors or entrepreneurs on **[Telegram](https://telegram.org/)** and invite targets to a virtual meeting. They direct the victim to a convincing phishing page masquerading as a **Zoom** or **Microsoft Teams** website. During the fake call, which uses pre-recorded audio to appear legitimate, the attacker claims there is an audio issue and tricks the target into running a malicious script to 'fix' it. This script initiates a multi-stage infection.\n\n-   **GhostHire Campaign:** This campaign targets Web3 developers with fake job offers. Attackers posing as recruiters convince the developer to download a malicious GitHub repository for a supposed skills assessment, which then deploys a payload tailored to the victim's operating system.\n\nKaspersky's investigation uncovered at least seven multi-stage execution chains and noted the attackers' use of AI to improve their productivity and refine their social engineering tactics.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nBlueNoroff's new campaigns show a significant investment in developing malware for macOS, a platform often perceived as more secure.\n\n-   **Initial Access:** The primary vector is highly targeted social engineering ([`T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002/)) delivered via platforms like Telegram.\n-   **Execution:** The initial payload is often a malicious script downloaded from a fake meeting site or a GitHub repository.\n-   **Malware Suite:** The infection chain deploys a suite of custom malware, including:\n    -   Keyloggers to capture passwords and other sensitive input.\n    -   A custom stealer designed to find and exfiltrate cryptocurrency wallet files, browser data, and session cookies.\n    -   Backdoors to provide persistent access to the compromised system.\n-   **Defense Evasion:** The use of legitimate platforms like GitHub and convincing phishing sites for Zoom and Teams helps the attackers bypass initial suspicion. The multi-stage nature of the infection also helps to evade detection by deploying payloads piece by piece.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nA successful compromise by BlueNoroff can lead to significant financial losses for both individuals and companies. By targeting venture capital executives and Web3 developers, the group aims to gain access to corporate or project treasuries containing large amounts of cryptocurrency. The impact includes:\n-   **Direct Financial Theft:** Loss of cryptocurrency assets from personal or corporate wallets.\n-   **Intellectual Property Theft:** Stealing proprietary code or investment strategies from Web3 projects and VC firms.\n-   **Reputational Damage:** The association with a North Korean state-sponsored cyberattack can damage the reputation of the affected firms.\n\nVictims have been identified in Japan, Italy, France, Singapore, Turkey, Spain, Sweden, India, Hong Kong, and Australia.\n\n## IOCs\nNo specific Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) were provided in the source articles.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n\n| Type                 | Value                                                 | Description                                                                                                                            |\n|:---------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| file_name            | `Zoom.pkg` or `Teams.pkg` from unofficial sources     | An installer package for Zoom or Teams downloaded from a link provided in a chat, rather than the official App Store or website.        |\n| domain               | Lookalike domains for `zoom.us` or `teams.microsoft.com`| Phishing domains designed to mimic legitimate meeting platforms.                                                                       |\n| process_name         | Unsigned processes making network connections         | On macOS, monitor for the execution of unsigned binaries that are establishing persistent network connections or accessing keychain data. |\n| command_line_pattern | `curl -sL [URL] | bash`                                | A common pattern for downloading and executing a script from the internet, often used for initial infection.                           |\n\n## Detection & Response\n1.  **Endpoint Security for macOS:** Deploy EDR solutions with strong macOS support to detect and block malicious scripts and unsigned binaries.\n2.  **User Awareness Training:** Educate high-risk employees (executives, developers) about these specific social engineering tactics, including fake meeting invites and job offers on platforms like Telegram.\n3.  **Process Monitoring:** On macOS, monitor for suspicious shell script execution, especially those that download additional files or attempt to escalate privileges.\n4.  **D3FEND Techniques:**\n    -   [`D3-EAL: Executable Allowlisting`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ExecutableAllowlisting) can prevent the execution of the malicious downloaders.\n    -   [`D3-UBA: User Behavior Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:UserBehaviorAnalysis) could potentially flag anomalous developer behavior, such as cloning an untrusted GitHub repository.\n\n## Mitigation\n1.  **Software Sourcing:** Enforce strict policies requiring employees to download software only from official sources, such as the Apple App Store or verified vendor websites. Never install software from a link sent via chat.\n2.  **Scrutinize Communications:** Be highly skeptical of unsolicited contact on platforms like Telegram, especially when it involves job offers or investment opportunities. Verify the identity of the person through separate, trusted channels.\n3.  **Hardware Wallets:** For storing significant cryptocurrency assets, use hardware wallets that keep private keys offline and are immune to malware on the host computer.\n4.  **Limit Privileges:** Operate on user accounts with standard, non-administrative privileges for daily tasks to limit the scope of what malware can do upon execution.\n5.  **D3FEND Countermeasures:**\n    -   [`D3-ACH: Application Configuration Hardening`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ApplicationConfigurationHardening) can be applied to browsers and other clients to reduce the attack surface.\n    -   [`D3-DO: Decoy Object`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:DecoyObject), such as a fake cryptocurrency wallet file, could be used to detect and alert on stealer activity.","North Korea's BlueNoroff APT targets macOS users in new 'GhostCall' & 'GhostHire' campaigns. 💻 The group uses fake Zoom/Teams clients and AI-driven social engineering to steal crypto from VCs and Web3 devs. #BlueNoroff #APT #macOS #ThreatIntel","The North Korean APT group BlueNoroff (APT38) is targeting macOS users in the crypto sector with new malware campaigns 'GhostCall' and 'GhostHire,' using sophisticated social engineering to steal cryptocurrency.",[13,14,15],"Threat Actor","Malware","Phishing","high",[18,22,24,26,29,33,36,38,40,42],{"name":19,"type":20,"url":21},"BlueNoroff","threat_actor","https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0063/",{"name":23,"type":20,"url":21},"APT38",{"name":25,"type":20},"Sapphire Sleet",{"name":27,"type":20,"url":28},"Lazarus Group","https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032/",{"name":30,"type":31,"url":32},"Kaspersky","security_organization","https://www.kaspersky.com",{"name":34,"type":35},"macOS","product",{"name":37,"type":35},"Zoom",{"name":39,"type":35},"Microsoft Teams",{"name":41,"type":35},"Telegram",{"name":43,"type":35},"GitHub",[],[46,52,57,62],{"url":47,"title":48,"date":49,"friendly_name":50,"website":51},"https://securelist.com/bluenoroffs-latest-campaigns-ghostcall-and-ghosthire/112630/","BlueNoroff’s latest campaigns: GhostCall and GhostHire","2025-10-28","Kaspersky Securelist","securelist.com",{"url":53,"title":54,"date":49,"friendly_name":55,"website":56},"https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/researchers-expose-ghostcall-and.html","Researchers Expose GhostCall and GhostHire: BlueNoroff's New Malware Chains","The Hacker News","thehackernews.com",{"url":58,"title":59,"date":49,"friendly_name":60,"website":61},"https://www.adnkronos.com/risorse/cronaca/cyber-security-kaspersky-rivlea-le-ultime-attivita-di-bluenoroff-apt_3hUuQ9vjTq1YcIdwX6dGqf","Kaspersky: BlueNoroff colpisce i dirigenti di aziende che usano Windows e macOS con tool basati sull'AI","Adnkronos","adnkronos.com",{"url":63,"title":64,"date":49,"friendly_name":65,"website":66},"https://www.reddit.com/r/SecOpsDaily/comments/17iwg7x/crypto_wasted_bluenoroffs_ghost_mirage_of/","Crypto wasted: BlueNoroff's ghost mirage of funding and jobs","Reddit","reddit.com",[68],{"datetime":69,"summary":70},"2025-04-01T00:00:00Z","The 'GhostCall' and 'GhostHire' campaigns are reported to have been active since at least this time.",[72,76,80,84,88,92],{"id":73,"name":74,"tactic":75},"T1589","Gather Victim Identity Information","Reconnaissance",{"id":77,"name":78,"tactic":79},"T1566.002","Spearphishing Link","Initial Access",{"id":81,"name":82,"tactic":83},"T1204.002","Malicious File","Execution",{"id":85,"name":86,"tactic":87},"T1105","Ingress Tool Transfer","Command and Control",{"id":89,"name":90,"tactic":91},"T1555","Credentials from Password Stores","Credential Access",{"id":93,"name":94,"tactic":95},"T1657","Financial Theft","Impact",[97,102,111],{"id":98,"name":99,"description":100,"domain":101},"M1017","User Training","Educating high-risk users about sophisticated social engineering tactics is a critical first line of defense.","enterprise",{"id":103,"name":104,"d3fend_techniques":105,"description":110,"domain":101},"M1038","Execution Prevention",[106],{"id":107,"name":108,"url":109},"D3-EAL","Executable Allowlisting","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ExecutableAllowlisting","Use application control on macOS to prevent the execution of unsigned or unauthorized applications and scripts.",{"id":112,"name":113,"d3fend_techniques":114,"description":119,"domain":101},"M1049","Antivirus/Antimalware",[115],{"id":116,"name":117,"url":118},"D3-PA","Process Analysis","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ProcessAnalysis","Deploy EDR and antivirus solutions capable of detecting malicious behavior on macOS endpoints.",[121,126],{"technique_id":122,"technique_name":123,"url":124,"recommendation":125,"mitre_mitigation_id":98},"D3-UBA","User Behavior Analysis","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:UserBehaviorAnalysis","Given the highly targeted social engineering nature of the 'GhostCall' and 'GhostHire' campaigns, User Behavior Analysis is a key defensive technique.
