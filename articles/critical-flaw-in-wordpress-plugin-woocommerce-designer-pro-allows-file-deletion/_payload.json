The flaw, rated 9.8 out of 10 on the CVSS scale, is a path traversal issue that allows an unauthenticated attacker to delete arbitrary files on the web server. This could lead to complete data loss, website destruction, or even remote code execution (RCE) by deleting critical files like wp-config.php and re-running the WordPress installation. The vulnerability affects all versions up to and including 1.9.26 and is also present in the 'Pricom' theme which bundles the plugin. Users are urged to update immediately.","## Executive Summary\nOn October 11, 2025, a critical security vulnerability, **[CVE-2025-6439](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-6439)**, was disclosed in the WooCommerce Designer Pro plugin for **[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)**. The flaw is an unauthenticated path traversal vulnerability with a CVSS 3.1 score of 9.8 (Critical). It allows a remote attacker to delete arbitrary files from the server hosting the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to cause a denial of service, wipe the entire website, or potentially achieve remote code execution (RCE) by deleting the WordPress configuration file and initiating a fresh installation. The vulnerability impacts all plugin versions up to 1.9.26 and is also present in the bundled 'Pricom - Printing Company & Design Services' theme. Immediate action is required from all users of the affected plugin or theme.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n*   **CVE ID**: `CVE-2025-6439`\n*   **CVSS 3.1 Score**: 9.8 (Critical) - `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`\n*   **CWE**: `CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')`\n*   **Affected Component**: The vulnerability lies within the `wcdpsavecanvasdesignajax` AJAX function of the plugin.\n*   **Attack Vector**: The flaw is exploitable via a crafted HTTP request sent to the WordPress AJAX endpoint (`/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`). No authentication is required.\n*   **Root Cause**: The function fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input that is used to construct a file path for a deletion operation. An attacker can use traversal sequences (`../`) to navigate outside the intended directory and target any file on the server that the web server process has permissions to delete.\n\n## Affected Systems\n*   **Plugin**: WooCommerce Designer Pro, versions \u003C= 1.9.26\n*   **Theme**: Pricom - Printing Company & Design Services (all versions bundling the vulnerable plugin)\n\nGiven the popularity of WooCommerce for e-commerce sites, a large number of online stores could be at risk if they use this specific design plugin.\n\n## Exploitation Status\nAs of the disclosure, there were no reports of active exploitation in the wild. However, due to the critical severity and the ease of exploitation (requiring only a single unauthenticated request), it is highly likely that threat actors will begin scanning for and exploiting vulnerable sites imminently. A public proof-of-concept is likely to appear quickly.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nSuccessful exploitation of `CVE-2025-6439` can have devastating consequences:\n\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: The most severe impact. An attacker can delete the `wp-config.php` file. This action forces WordPress to trigger its installation process. The attacker can then go through the installation steps, connect the site to a database they control, and gain full administrative access, allowing them to upload malicious plugins or themes to achieve RCE.\n*   **Complete Data Loss**: An attacker could delete the entire WordPress installation, including themes, plugins, and uploaded media files.\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Deleting critical server or application files can render the website completely inoperable.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n| Type | Value | Description | Context | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| url_pattern | `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` | The endpoint for WordPress AJAX calls. | Monitor POST requests to this endpoint containing the `wcdpsavecanvasdesignajax` action and path traversal characters (`../`). | high |\n| command_line_pattern | `action=wcdpsavecanvasdesignajax` | The specific AJAX action that is vulnerable. | WAF logs, web server access logs. | high |\n| file_path | `wp-config.php` | Deletion of this file is a key indicator of an RCE attempt via this vulnerability. | File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) alerts. | high |\n\n## Detection Methods\n1.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Deploy a WAF with rules that specifically block requests to `admin-ajax.php` containing the `wcdpsavecanvasdesignajax` action and path traversal sequences. This is a form of **[D3FEND Inbound Traffic Filtering](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:InboundTrafficFiltering)**.\n2.  **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**: Implement FIM on critical WordPress files, especially `wp-config.php`. An alert on the deletion of this file should be treated as a critical security incident.\n3.  **Log Analysis**: Ingest web server access logs into a SIEM and create rules to alert on POST requests matching the observable patterns described above.\n\n## Remediation Steps\n1.  **Update Immediately ([`M1051 - Update Software`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1051/))**: The primary remediation is to update the WooCommerce Designer Pro plugin to a patched version. Users should check the plugin's official repository or vendor site for the latest secure version.\n2.  **Disable/Remove Plugin**: If a patch is not available or cannot be applied immediately, disable and delete the plugin from all WordPress sites to remove the vulnerable code.\n3.  **Check for Compromise**: If you were running a vulnerable version, assume compromise. Check for the existence of `wp-config.php`. If it is missing, immediately restore the site from a known-good backup and change all database, FTP, and WordPress admin credentials.","🚨 CRITICAL 9.8 CVSS flaw (CVE-2025-6439) in WooCommerce Designer Pro WordPress plugin.
