Organizations must now inform affected California residents of a data breach involving unencrypted personal information within 30 calendar days of its discovery. This amendment to the state's already stringent privacy laws places increased pressure on companies to have highly efficient incident detection and response processes in place to meet the accelerated deadline.","## Executive Summary\n**[California](https://www.ca.gov/)** has further solidified its position as the leader in U.S. data privacy regulation by enacting Senate Bill 446 (SB 446). This new law amends the state's data breach notification requirements, mandating that businesses notify affected California residents within a strict 30-calendar-day window following the discovery of a breach. This represents a significant acceleration from the previous standard of 'the most expedient time possible.' The law places substantial pressure on organizations to optimize their incident response capabilities, from detection and investigation to notification and remediation, to ensure compliance and avoid potential penalties.\n\n---\n\n## Regulatory Details\nSB 446 introduces several key changes to California's data breach notification statute:\n-   **30-Day Notification Deadline:** The core provision requires businesses to notify affected California residents of a breach of unencrypted personal information within 30 days of discovering the breach. Discovery is defined as the point at which the business has sufficient evidence to reasonably conclude that a breach has occurred.\n-   **Attorney General Reporting:** The timeline for reporting breaches affecting more than 500 California residents to the state's Attorney General has also been shortened, aligning with the new consumer notification window.\n-   **Notice Requirements:** The notification sent to consumers must be clearly titled 'Notice of Data Breach' and must be written in plain, easy-to-understand language.\n-   **Scope:** The law applies to any person or business that conducts business in California and owns or licenses computerized data that includes personal information.\n\n## Affected Organizations\nThis law impacts a vast number of organizations, including:\n-   Any company, regardless of its physical location, that has customers or employees in California.\n-   Data brokers and any entity that handles the personal information of California residents.\n\n## Compliance Requirements\nTo comply with SB 446, organizations must ensure their incident response programs are capable of:\n1.  **Rapid Detection and Triage:** Quickly identifying a potential security incident.\n2.  **Efficient Investigation:** Swiftly investigating the incident to determine the scope, nature of the compromised data, and number of affected individuals.\n3.  **Legal Consultation:** Engaging legal counsel early to interpret notification obligations under the new timeline.\n4.  **Notification Preparation:** Drafting and distributing compliant breach notifications to all affected California residents and the Attorney General within the 30-day window.\n\n## Implementation Timeline\nThe bill has been signed into law by the Governor, and its requirements are now in effect. Organizations must adjust their policies and procedures immediately to reflect the new, shorter timeline.\n\n## Impact Assessment\n-   **Operational Pressure:** The 30-day deadline compresses the entire incident response lifecycle. Investigations that previously could take weeks or months must now yield actionable conclusions much faster.\n-   **Increased Costs:** The need for speed may require organizations to increase investment in incident response retainers, forensic services, and legal counsel.\n-   **Risk of Inaccurate Notifications:** Rushing the investigation to meet the deadline could lead to incomplete or inaccurate notifications, potentially requiring follow-up communications and causing further consumer confusion and reputational damage.\n-   **National Trendsetter:** California's laws often set a de facto national standard. Other states may follow suit with similarly short notification deadlines, creating a complex patchwork of regulations for businesses to navigate.\n\n## Compliance Guidance\n1.  **Update Incident Response Plans:** Review and revise your IR plan to explicitly incorporate the 30-day notification requirement for California residents. Define clear roles, responsibilities, and escalation paths.\n2.  **Conduct Tabletop Exercises:** Run breach simulation exercises that specifically test your organization's ability to meet the 30-day deadline. Identify bottlenecks in your current processes.\n3.  **Pre-Vet Third Parties:** Establish retainers with external forensic investigation firms and outside legal counsel specializing in data privacy. This ensures they are ready to engage immediately when an incident occurs.\n4.  **Automate and Orchestrate:** Leverage Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms to automate routine investigation tasks, freeing up human analysts to focus on critical analysis and decision-making.","California tightens data breach rules with new law SB 446. üìú Businesses must now notify affected residents within 30 days of discovering a breach.
