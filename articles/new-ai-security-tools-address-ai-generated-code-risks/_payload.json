Legit Security has launched 'VibeGuard,' a tool designed to secure AI-generated code within integrated development environments (IDEs). Simultaneously, Cyware has upgraded its 'Quarterback AI' platform to function as an 'AI Fabric' for security operations, aiming to boost threat intelligence and analyst productivity. These launches highlight the industry's focus on both securing AI's use and using AI for defense.","## Executive Summary\nThis week, the cybersecurity industry has seen the launch of new products aimed at addressing the dual challenges of Artificial Intelligence: securing its use in development and leveraging it for better defense. **[Legit Security](https://www.legit.security/)** introduced 'VibeGuard' to protect against risks from AI-generated code, while **[Cyware](https://cyware.com/)** announced a major upgrade to its 'Quarterback AI' solution to streamline security operations. These developments reflect a maturing market that is moving to create guardrails for AI adoption and harness its power for improved security outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## Securing AI-Assisted Development\n**Legit Security** has launched **VibeGuard**, a solution specifically designed to address the security risks associated with AI-assisted software development. As developers increasingly rely on AI tools and coding agents within their Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), new attack surfaces emerge.\n\n**VibeGuard's** key functions include:\n- **Securing AI-Generated Code:** It scans code generated by AI at the point of creation, identifying vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, and insecure coding practices before the code is committed to a repository.\n- **Protecting AI Agents:** The tool monitors the behavior of the AI coding agents themselves, aiming to prevent attacks that could manipulate or poison the AI to produce malicious code.\n- **IDE Integration:** By integrating directly into the developer's workflow, it provides real-time feedback without causing friction, promoting a 'secure by design' approach for AI-generated software.\n\nThis addresses a critical gap in the software supply chain, as insecure AI-generated code can introduce vulnerabilities that are difficult to trace and remediate later in the development lifecycle.\n\n---\n\n## Leveraging AI for Security Operations\n**Cyware** has released a significant upgrade to its **Quarterback AI** platform, rebranding it as an 'AI Fabric'. This enhancement combines multiple AI capabilities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of security operations (SecOps) and threat intelligence teams.\n\nThe upgraded platform integrates:\n- **Generative AI:** For summarizing threat reports, generating incident summaries, and creating natural language queries.\n- **Agentic AI:** Autonomous agents that can perform routine investigation and enrichment tasks, freeing up human analysts.\n- **In-Product AI:** AI capabilities embedded directly into SecOps workflows to provide context-aware recommendations and automate response actions.\n\nThe goal is to accelerate the entire threat intelligence lifecycle, from collection and analysis to dissemination and action, ultimately improving analyst productivity and reducing response times.\n\n---\n\n## Industry Trend and Impact\nThese product launches signify a crucial trend in the cybersecurity industry. The initial phase of AI adoption was marked by rapid, often unsecured, integration into business processes. The market is now entering a second phase focused on governance, risk management, and security for AI systems. Tools like **VibeGuard** represent the 'secure the AI' side of the coin, while platforms like **Quarterback AI** represent the 'use AI to secure' side. Both are essential for organizations to safely harness the benefits of AI without exposing themselves to unacceptable levels of risk. As AI becomes ubiquitous, solutions that can manage its security implications will become a standard part of the enterprise security stack.","🛠️ New tools for the AI era: Legit Security launches 'VibeGuard' to secure AI-generated code, while Cyware upgrades 'Quarterback AI' for enhanced SecOps. #AI #DevSecOps #CyberSecurity #ThreatIntel","Cybersecurity vendors Legit Security and Cyware have released new tools, VibeGuard and an updated Quarterback AI, to address the security risks of AI-generated code and improve security operations.",[13,14,15],"Other","Security Operations","Cloud Security","informational",[18,21,24,26],{"name":19,"type":20},"Legit Security","vendor",{"name":22,"type":23},"VibeGuard","product",{"name":25,"type":20},"Cyware",{"name":27,"type":23},"Quarterback AI",[],[30,36],{"url":31,"title":32,"date":33,"friendly_name":34,"website":35},"https://solutionsreview.com/endpoint-security/endpoint-security-and-network-monitoring-news-for-the-week-of-november-14th-rockwell-automation-commvault-legit-security-and-more/","Endpoint Security and Network Monitoring News for the Week of November 14th: Rockwell Automation, Commvault, Legit Security, and More - Solutions Review","2025-11-14","Solutions Review","solutionsreview.com",{"url":37,"title":38,"date":33,"friendly_name":39,"website":40},"https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/2025/11/14/security-and-ai-news-from-the-week-beginning-3rd-november-2025/","Security and AI news from the week beginning 3rd November 2025 - - Enterprise Times","Enterprise Times","enterprisetimes.co.uk",[],[],[],[],[],[],[48,49,50,19,25,51],"AI security","DevSecOps","generative AI","software supply chain","2025-11-14T15:00:00.000Z","NewsArticle",{"geographic_scope":55},"global",3,{"articles":58,"totalCount":3727,"lastUpdated":3728},[59,82,105,124,144,157,173,186,201,213,226,244,259,270,285,299,312,324,337,353,368,382,395,408,419,430,441,452,464,479,492,501,513,524,536,549,558,570,581,590,601,612,626,638,653,667,680,694,708,726,737,749,765,780,793,804,817,830,844,857,873,888,902,917,930,933,945,961,971,983,994,1007,1020,1032,1041,1053,1063,1073,1085,1098,1111,1125,1137,1147,1159,1172,1184,1193,1206,1219,1227,1238,1252,1262,1272,1284,1300,1310,1323,1334,1346,1356,1368,1379,1389,1401,1412,1423,1434,1443,1454,1468,1479,1487,1500,1508,1518,1528,1542,1552,1561,1574,1585,1601,1613,1625,1638,1650,1663,1677,1690,1700,1714,1723,1734,1747,1761,1773,1783,1796,1806,1817,1828,1841,1857,1867,1877,1888,1901,1915,1926,1939,1949,1960,1971,1982,1995,2007,2020,2033,2043,2055,2068,2082,2092,2104,2116,2127,2141,2152,2162,2173,2185,2196,2206,2219,2228,2239,2253,2263,2276,2284,2295,2306,2318,2327,2338,2350,2363,2376,2387,2402,2415,2425,2436,2446,2455,2465,2480,2492,2503,2513,2523,2534,2545,2557,2568,2581,2592,2607,2618,2632,2645,2657,2666,2677,2689,2698,2709,2720,2732,2743,2753,2767,2778,2790,2801,2814,2825,2839,2850,2862,2873,2884,2894,2904,2914,2925,2935,2947,2959,2972,2981,2994,3005,3016,3025,3035,3046,3056,3067,3078,3089,3099,3109,3121,3131,3145,3157,3167,3177,3186,3197,3207,3217,3230,3240,3250,3263,3273,3284,3295,3307,3319,3331,3341,3352,3364,3374,3385,3395,3405,3415,3424,3434,3446,3460,3470,3483,3493,3504,3513,3523,3533,3542,3551,3560,3570,3579,3590,3600,3611,3619,3628,3637,3647,3657,3668,3678,3689,3697,3706,3716],{"id":60,"slug":61,"headline":62,"title":63,"severity":64,"article_type":53,"excerpt":65,"tags":66,"categories":74,"createdAt":78,"updatedAt":78,"displayDate":79,"isUpdated":80,"readingTime":81},"440d30a0-2641-4542-95e7-fdf83694a197","akira-ransomware-exploits-unpatched-sonicwall-devices-during-ma","Akira Ransomware Targets M&A Blind Spots, Breaching Firms via Inherited SonicWall Devices","Akira Ransomware Exploits M&A Security Gaps by Infiltrating Networks Through Unpatched SonicWall Appliances","high","The Akira ransomware group is exploiting security blind spots created during corporate mergers and acquisitions (M&A).
