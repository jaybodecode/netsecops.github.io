The flaw, announced on October 7, 2025, allows an authenticated attacker to escape the Lua sandbox and achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the underlying server. The risk is especially high for the estimated 330,000 internet-exposed Redis instances, around 60,000 of which are believed to have no authentication enabled. Because official Redis container images disable authentication by default, these instances are vulnerable to unauthenticated RCE. Security agencies like Germany's BSI are warning of imminent exploitation.","## Executive Summary\nOn October 7, 2025, **[Redis](https://redis.com/)** announced patches for a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, **`CVE-2025-49844`**. Discovered by researchers at **[Wiz](https://www.wiz.io)** and dubbed \"RediShell,\" the flaw is a use-after-free memory corruption bug that enables an attacker to escape the Lua scripting sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the host operating system. While the vulnerability requires authentication, the risk is dramatically amplified by the widespread misconfiguration of Redis instances. An estimated 60,000 of the 330,000 internet-exposed Redis servers lack authentication, making them vulnerable to unauthenticated RCE. The issue is exacerbated by official Redis container images, which disable authentication by default. Due to the attack's simplicity and Redis's popularity, widespread exploitation is expected.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n**`CVE-2025-49844`** (\"RediShell\") is a critical use-after-free vulnerability in the Redis server's implementation of the Lua scripting engine. Lua scripting is a default feature in Redis, allowing users to execute complex commands atomically.\n\n### Technical Description\nAn attacker with the ability to execute Lua scripts can submit a specially crafted script that triggers a memory corruption condition. This allows the attacker to break out of the constraints of the Lua sandbox and execute native code directly on the server. This provides the attacker with the same level of privilege as the Redis process itself. The attack is reportedly simple to execute once the initial script is developed.\n\n## Affected Systems\n*   **Redis** versions that support Lua scripting (default in most modern versions). Specific affected version ranges are detailed in the official Redis advisory.\n*   Instances running in containers using the official Redis image are at high risk if they have not been manually configured with authentication.\n\n## Exploitation Status\nAs of October 7, 2025, no active exploitation has been publicly confirmed, but security researchers and agencies like Germany's **Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)** anticipate that attacks will begin imminently. The combination of a large number of exposed, unauthenticated instances and the severity of the flaw (RCE) makes it a highly attractive target for attackers.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nSuccessful exploitation of RediShell grants an attacker full control over the Redis server, leading to severe consequences:\n*   **Data Theft**: Attackers can exfiltrate all data stored within the Redis instance, which often includes sensitive session tokens, user data, and application caches.\n*   **Lateral Movement**: If the Redis server is running in a cloud environment like AWS or GCP, the attacker can steal IAM role credentials from the instance metadata service. This allows them to pivot and attack other cloud resources. ([`T1528 - Steal Application Access Token`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528/))\n*   **Ransomware/Cryptojacking**: The attacker can use the compromised server to deploy ransomware within the network or install cryptomining malware, consuming system resources. ([`T1496 - Resource Hijacking`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1496/))\n*   **Persistence**: The attacker can establish persistence on the host system, ensuring continued access even if the Redis service is restarted. ([`T1547.001 - Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/))\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\nDetection efforts should focus on Redis server logs and host-based monitoring.\n\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `log_source` | Redis Logs | Monitor for execution of unusual or abnormally complex Lua scripts, especially from untrusted sources. |\n| `command_line_pattern` | `redis-server` | Monitor for anomalous child processes spawned by the `redis-server` process, such as shells (`/bin/sh`, `bash`) or network utilities (`curl`, `wget`). |\n| `network_traffic_pattern` | Outbound connections from Redis server | A Redis server should typically only communicate with application servers. Alert on any outbound connections to the internet or other unexpected systems. |\n| `port` | `6379` | Monitor for connection attempts to the default Redis port from unauthorized or external IP addresses. |\n\n## Detection Methods\n1.  **Host-Based Monitoring**: Use an EDR agent on Redis hosts to detect suspicious process creation. A `redis-server` process spawning a shell is a major red flag. This aligns with D3FEND's [`Process Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ProcessAnalysis).\n2.  **Network Security Monitoring**: Analyze network traffic to and from Redis servers. Alert on connections from the public internet if the server should be internal-only. Monitor for large, unexpected data transfers. Use D3FEND's [`Outbound Traffic Filtering`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:OutboundTrafficFiltering) to block unauthorized connections.\n3.  **Audit Redis Commands**: If supported, enable auditing of Redis commands and look for the execution of `EVAL` or `EVALSHA` with suspicious-looking Lua scripts.\n\n## Remediation Steps\n1.  **Patch Immediately**: Upgrade all Redis instances to the patched versions as specified by Redis. This is the most effective solution and a direct application of D3FEND's [`Software Update`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SoftwareUpdate).\n2.  **Enforce Authentication**: For any Redis instance, especially those exposed to the network, enable strong password authentication (the `requirepass` directive). This is a critical security best practice that would mitigate the unauthenticated attack vector.\n3.  **Restrict Network Access**: Configure firewall rules to ensure that Redis servers are only accessible from the specific application servers that require access. Never expose a Redis instance directly to the public internet. This is a form of D3FEND [`Inbound Traffic Filtering`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:InboundTrafficFiltering).\n4.  **Run as Low-Privilege User**: Configure Redis to run as a dedicated, low-privilege user (`redis`) rather than `root`. This contains the impact of a successful sandbox escape, preventing an immediate full system compromise.","üö® CRITICAL VULNERABILITY: Redis patches \"RediShell\" (CVE-2025-49844), an RCE flaw allowing Lua sandbox escape. 60k+ internet-exposed servers may be unauthenticated and at risk.
