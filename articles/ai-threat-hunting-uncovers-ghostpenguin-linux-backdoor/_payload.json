The malware remained completely undetected on VirusTotal for over four months after its initial submission. It was ultimately found using an AI-driven automated threat hunting pipeline designed to analyze zero-detection samples. GhostPenguin provides attackers with full remote shell access and file system control over an RC5-encrypted UDP channel, using port 53 to masquerade as DNS traffic, highlighting the growing need for AI in detecting emerging, stealthy threats.","## Executive Summary\n**[Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com)** researchers have identified a previously unknown Linux backdoor, **GhostPenguin**, showcasing the power of AI-driven threat hunting. The malware sample was first submitted to VirusTotal on July 7, 2025, but remained undetected by all signature-based scanners for over four months. It was discovered by an automated AI pipeline designed to find needles in a haystack of benign files. GhostPenguin is a fully-featured backdoor written in C++ that provides remote shell access, file transfer capabilities, and system reconnaissance. It employs multiple stealth techniques, including communicating over UDP port 53 (typically for DNS) and encrypting its C2 traffic with the RC5 cipher. The discovery underscores the limitations of traditional detection methods against novel threats and the increasing value of machine learning in cybersecurity.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\nGhostPenguin is a sophisticated backdoor designed for stealth and comprehensive control over infected Linux systems. Its key features include:\n- **Full Remote Control**: Provides attackers with a remote shell via `/bin/sh`, allowing arbitrary command execution.\n- **File System Manipulation**: Capabilities include creating, deleting, reading, and writing files on the compromised host.\n- **Stealthy C2 Communication**: The backdoor communicates with its C2 servers (`65.20.72.101:53` and `124.221.109.147:5679`) using UDP. The use of port 53 is a deliberate choice to blend in with legitimate DNS traffic, making it harder to spot on the network.\n- **Encrypted Channel**: All C2 communications are encrypted using the RC5 stream cipher, preventing casual network inspection from revealing the content of the commands or exfiltrated data.\n- **Persistence and Singleton**: Upon execution, it creates a `.temp` file in the user's home directory containing its process ID (PID) to ensure only one instance of the backdoor runs at a time.\n\nAnalysis of the malware binary revealed debug strings and unused functions, suggesting it is an active project and may be enhanced with new capabilities in the future.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nGhostPenguin's TTPs map to the MITRE ATT&CK framework as follows:\n- **Execution**: [`T1059.004 - Unix Shell`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004/) is invoked to provide the remote shell functionality.\n- **Command and Control**: The malware uses [`T1071.004 - Application Layer Protocol: DNS`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/004/) by communicating over UDP port 53. The communication is encrypted, which aligns with [`T1573.001 - Encrypted Channel: Symmetric Cryptography`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/001/).\n- **Discovery**: Upon execution, it gathers system information such as IP address, hostname, and OS version, mapping to [`T1082 - System Information Discovery`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/) and [`T1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016/).\n- **Defense Evasion**: Creating a hidden lock file (`.temp`) is a form of [`T1564.001 - Hidden Files and Directories`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/001/).\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe impact of a GhostPenguin infection is severe. As a full-featured backdoor, it grants an attacker complete control over the compromised Linux server. This can lead to:\n- **Data Theft**: Attackers can exfiltrate any sensitive data, databases, or intellectual property stored on the server.\n- **Pivot Point**: The compromised server can be used as a staging ground to launch further attacks against other systems within the internal network.\n- **Resource Hijacking**: The server's resources can be used for malicious activities like hosting phishing sites, launching DDoS attacks, or mining cryptocurrency.\n- **Persistent Access**: The backdoor provides long-term, stealthy access, allowing attackers to wait for the opportune moment to act.\n\n## IOCs\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `ip_address_v4` | `65.20.72.101` | C2 Server IP Address |\n| `ip_address_v4` | `124.221.109.147` | C2 Server IP Address |\n| `destination_port` | `53` | C2 Port (UDP) |\n| `destination_port` | `5679` | C2 Port (UDP) |\n| `file_name` | `.temp` | Lock file created in the user's home directory. |\n\n## Detection & Response\n- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Since GhostPenguin was undetected by file-based scanners, network-based detection is key. Monitor for and investigate any UDP traffic on port 53 that does not conform to the DNS protocol standard. This is a core concept of D3FEND's [`D3-NTA: Network Traffic Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkTrafficAnalysis).\n- **Egress Filtering**: Block outbound UDP traffic to the known C2 IP addresses (`65.20.72.101`, `124.221.109.147`) at the network perimeter. This is an application of [`D3-OTF: Outbound Traffic Filtering`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:OutboundTrafficFiltering).\n- **Threat Hunting**: Hunt for the presence of the `.temp` lock file in user home directories (`~/`). Also, hunt for suspicious processes running from unexpected locations or processes that are holding open a UDP socket to an external IP on port 53.\n- **YARA Scanning**: Use YARA rules to scan files on disk and in memory for characteristics of GhostPenguin. Trend Micro and other researchers will likely publish rules based on the malware's strings and code structure.\n\n## Mitigation\n1.  **Endpoint Security for Linux**: Deploy modern EDR solutions on Linux servers. While signature-based AV failed here, behavioral detection engines in EDRs may be able to identify the suspicious actions of the backdoor, such as spawning a shell or making unusual network connections.\n2.  **Principle of Least Privilege**: Run services and applications with dedicated, low-privilege user accounts to limit the impact of a compromise.\n3.  **Network Segmentation**: Segment server networks to prevent a compromised machine from easily accessing other parts of the environment.\n4.  **Logging and Monitoring**: Ensure comprehensive logging is enabled for process execution (`auditd`) and network connections on Linux servers. Forward these logs to a SIEM for correlation and analysis.","AI-powered threat hunting uncovers 'GhostPenguin,' a C++ Linux backdoor that evaded AV detection for 4+ months. 🐧 The malware uses RC5-encrypted UDP over port 53 for stealthy C2. #Linux #Malware #ThreatHunting #AI #InfoSec","An AI-driven threat hunting pipeline discovered 'GhostPenguin,' a stealthy Linux backdoor that remained undetected for months, using encrypted UDP for C2 communications.",[13,14,15],"Malware","Threat Intelligence","Security Operations","medium",[18,21,25,28,31],{"name":19,"type":20},"GhostPenguin","malware",{"name":22,"type":23,"url":24},"Trend Micro","vendor","https://www.trendmicro.com/",{"name":26,"type":27},"VirusTotal","product",{"name":29,"type":30},"RC5","technology",{"name":32,"type":27,"url":33},"Linux","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux",[],[36,41,47],{"url":37,"title":38,"date":39,"friendly_name":22,"website":40},"https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/l/ai-automated-threat-hunting-brings-ghostpenguin-out-of-the-shado.html","AI-Automated Threat Hunting Brings GhostPenguin Out of the Shadows","2025-12-08","trendmicro.com",{"url":42,"title":43,"date":44,"friendly_name":45,"website":46},"https://gbhackers.on-security/2025/12/ai-driven-tools-uncover-ghostpenguin.html","AI-Driven Tools Uncover GhostPenguin Backdoor Attacking Linux Servers","2025-12-09","GBHackers","gbhackers.on-security",{"url":48,"title":49,"date":44,"friendly_name":50,"website":51},"https://dailycybersecurity.com/ai-uncovers-ghostpenguin-undetectable-linux-backdoor/","AI Uncovers GhostPenguin: Undetectable Linux Backdoor Used RC5-Encrypted UDP for Covert C2","Daily Cybersecurity","dailycybersecurity.com",[53,56],{"datetime":54,"summary":55},"2025-07-07T00:00:00Z","The GhostPenguin malware sample is first uploaded to VirusTotal, where it remains undetected.",{"datetime":57,"summary":58},"2025-12-08T00:00:00Z","Trend Micro publicly discloses the discovery of GhostPenguin through its AI-powered threat hunting system.",[60,64,67,71,75],{"id":61,"name":62,"tactic":63},"T1071.004","Application Layer Protocol: DNS","Command and Control",{"id":65,"name":66,"tactic":63},"T1573.001","Encrypted Channel: Symmetric Cryptography",{"id":68,"name":69,"tactic":70},"T1059.004","Unix Shell","Execution",{"id":72,"name":73,"tactic":74},"T1082","System Information Discovery","Discovery",{"id":76,"name":77,"tactic":78},"T1564.001","Hidden Files and Directories","Defense Evasion",[80,90,95],{"id":81,"name":82,"d3fend_techniques":83,"description":88,"domain":89},"M1037","Filter Network Traffic",[84],{"id":85,"name":86,"url":87},"D3-OTF","Outbound Traffic Filtering","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:OutboundTrafficFiltering","Implement egress filtering to block outbound traffic to the known C2 IPs and analyze UDP port 53 traffic for non-DNS patterns.","enterprise",{"id":91,"name":92,"d3fend_techniques":93,"description":94,"domain":89},"M1040","Behavior Prevention on Endpoint",[],"Use an EDR to detect anomalous behaviors, such as a web service process spawning a shell, which is characteristic of backdoor activity.",{"id":96,"name":97,"d3fend_techniques":98,"description":103,"domain":89},"M1049","Antivirus/Antimalware",[99],{"id":100,"name":101,"url":102},"D3-PA","Process Analysis","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ProcessAnalysis","While signature-based detection failed initially, behavioral and heuristic engines in modern EDR/AV solutions are crucial for catching such threats.",[105,111],{"technique_id":106,"technique_name":107,"url":108,"recommendation":109,"mitre_mitigation_id":110},"D3-NTA","Network Traffic Analysis","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkTrafficAnalysis","To detect GhostPenguin's C2 communication, network traffic analysis is paramount.

Instead, deploy a network analysis tool like Zeek or Suricata that performs protocol validation. Configure it to alert on any traffic over UDP/53 that does not conform to the RFC standards for DNS queries and responses. GhostPenguin's RC5-encrypted, long-lived connection will not look like legitimate DNS traffic. Furthermore, create specific rules to block and alert on any outbound traffic to the known C2 IPs: `65.20.72.101` and `124.221.109.147`. This network-centric approach is the most reliable way to detect this threat, as it bypasses the malware's file-based stealth.","M1031",{"technique_id":100,"technique_name":101,"url":102,"recommendation":112,"mitre_mitigation_id":96},"On your Linux servers, use an EDR or `auditd` to monitor for anomalous process behavior.
