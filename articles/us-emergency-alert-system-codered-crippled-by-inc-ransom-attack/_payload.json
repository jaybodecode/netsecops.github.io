The attack, which began on November 1, 2025, resulted in the encryption of systems and the exfiltration of user data, including names, addresses, and contact information. After failed ransom negotiations, the vendor was forced to decommission the legacy platform, causing significant service disruptions for local governments in numerous states and leaving them unable to issue vital public safety notifications.","## Executive Summary\n\nA significant ransomware attack attributed to the **[Inc Ransom](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/inc_ransom)** group has crippled the **[OnSolve](https://www.onsolve.com/)** **[CodeRED](https://www.onsolve.com/solutions/products/codered/)** emergency notification system, a platform used by hundreds of local government and law enforcement agencies across the United States. The attack, which involved both data encryption and exfiltration, has forced the vendor to decommission the affected legacy platform, leading to widespread service disruptions. This incident highlights the vulnerability of critical public safety infrastructure to cyberattacks and the severe real-world consequences, as municipalities are left without a primary tool for issuing urgent alerts for events like natural disasters, active threats, and missing person reports. The attackers claim to have stolen user data after a ransom negotiation for $100,000 failed, escalating the incident from disruption to a significant data breach.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\n\nThe attack was initiated on November 1, 2025, when the Inc Ransom group claims to have first gained access to OnSolve's network. The ransomware payload was deployed on November 10, encrypting systems and disrupting the legacy CodeRED platform. On November 22, Inc Ransom publicly listed OnSolve on its data leak site, claiming responsibility and stating that negotiations with the vendor had failed. \n\nThe primary impact is the loss of a critical public communication channel for numerous communities. Local governments in states including Massachusetts, Colorado, Texas, Florida, and California have publicly acknowledged the outage. The compromised data includes sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of registered users, such as names, physical addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and hashed passwords. **[Crisis24](https://www.crisis24.com/)**, OnSolve's parent company, has confirmed the data exfiltration and is in the process of migrating customers to a new, unaffected platform, but the transition has been disruptive.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nThe attack follows a typical double-extortion ransomware model. While the exact initial access vector has not been disclosed, it likely involved common methods such as phishing, exploitation of a public-facing vulnerability, or compromised credentials.\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK Techniques Observed or Inferred:**\n- **Initial Access:** Likely [`T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/) or [`T1078 - Valid Accounts`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/).\n- **Execution:** [`T1059.001 - PowerShell`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/) is commonly used by ransomware groups for execution and lateral movement.\n- **Persistence:** Attackers may have used [`T1547.001 - Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/) to maintain their foothold.\n- **Defense Evasion:** [`T1490 - Inhibit System Recovery`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490/) by deleting shadow copies is a standard ransomware tactic.\n- **Credential Access:** [`T1003 - OS Credential Dumping`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/) would have been used to harvest credentials for lateral movement.\n- **Exfiltration:** [`T1048 - Exfiltration Over Alternative Medium`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048/) was used to steal user data before encryption.\n- **Impact:** [`T1486 - Data Encrypted for Impact`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/) was the final stage, rendering the CodeRED system inoperable.\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\nThe operational impact is severe. The inability to issue emergency alerts poses a direct risk to public safety. For example, a community could be unable to warn residents of a fast-moving wildfire, a chemical spill, or an active shooter situation. This erodes public trust in emergency services and local government. Financially, OnSolve faces costs related to incident response, platform migration, potential regulatory fines for the data breach, and loss of revenue as frustrated customers consider alternative providers. Affected municipalities must scramble to find and implement replacement notification systems, incurring unexpected costs and creating a temporary gap in their emergency response capabilities. The breach of user PII also exposes affected individuals to risks of identity theft, phishing, and other forms of fraud.\n\n## IOCs\nNo specific Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as file hashes or C2 domains were provided in the source articles.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\nSecurity teams should hunt for TTPs associated with Inc Ransom and similar ransomware groups:\n\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `command_line_pattern` | `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet` | Command to delete Volume Shadow Copies to prevent recovery. |\n| `process_name` | `wmic.exe` | Often used for reconnaissance and lateral movement. |\n| `network_traffic_pattern` | Unusual large outbound data transfers to cloud storage providers or unknown IPs. | Potential data exfiltration activity. |\n| `log_source` | `Windows Security Event Logs` | Monitor for Event ID `4625` (failed logons) and `4624` (successful logons) from unusual sources. |\n| `file_name` | `*.inc_ransom` | Default file extension used by Inc Ransom for encrypted files. |\n\n## Detection & Response\n- **EDR/XDR:** Deploy and monitor EDR solutions to detect ransomware behaviors such as rapid file encryption, deletion of shadow copies ([`D3-PA: Process Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ProcessAnalysis)), and suspicious process execution from tools like `PsExec` or `WMI`.\n- **Network Monitoring:** Implement [`D3-NTA: Network Traffic Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkTrafficAnalysis) to baseline normal traffic patterns and alert on anomalous outbound data flows that could indicate exfiltration. Pay close attention to traffic from critical servers to unfamiliar destinations.\n- **Log Analysis:** Centralize and analyze logs from critical systems. Look for patterns of failed and successful logins from unusual geo-locations or at odd hours. Monitor for the creation of new administrative accounts.\n- **Canary Files:** Place decoy files (honeypots) on file shares. Configure alerts to trigger if these files are accessed or encrypted, providing an early warning of a ransomware attack in progress ([`D3-DO: Decoy Object`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:DecoyObject)).\n\n## Mitigation\n- **Backup and Recovery:** Maintain immutable, offline backups of critical data and systems. Regularly test restoration procedures to ensure they are effective in a real-world incident.\n- **Network Segmentation:** Implement robust [`D3-NI: Network Isolation`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkIsolation) to separate critical infrastructure environments from corporate networks. Restrict east-west traffic to prevent attackers from moving laterally.\n- **Access Control:** Enforce the principle of least privilege. Implement strong password policies and mandate **[Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](https://www.cisa.gov/mfa)** for all remote access, privileged accounts, and critical system logins.\n- **Patch Management:** Aggressively patch internet-facing systems and critical vulnerabilities, especially those known to be exploited by ransomware groups. Prioritize patching of VPN concentrators, firewalls, and remote access solutions.","🚨 Ransomware attack by 'Inc Ransom' cripples the CodeRED emergency alert system across the U.S. The attack has disrupted a critical public safety tool & compromised user data, forcing the vendor to decommission the legacy platform. #Ransomware #CyberAttack #CodeRED","A ransomware attack by the 'Inc Ransom' group has disabled the OnSolve CodeRED emergency alert system, impacting public safety notifications across the United States and resulting in a user data breach.",[13,14,15],"Ransomware","Cyberattack","Data Breach","high",[18,22,26,29],{"name":19,"type":20,"url":21},"Inc Ransom","threat_actor","https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/inc_ransom",{"name":23,"type":24,"url":25},"OnSolve","company","https://www.onsolve.com/",{"name":27,"type":24,"url":28},"Crisis24","https://www.crisis24.com/",{"name":30,"type":31,"url":32},"CodeRED","product","https://www.onsolve.com/solutions/products/codered/",[],[35,41,46,52],{"url":36,"title":37,"date":38,"friendly_name":39,"website":40},"https://www.securityweek.com/ransomware-attack-disrupts-local-emergency-alert-system-across-us/","Ransomware Attack Disrupts Local Emergency Alert System Across US","2025-11-26","SecurityWeek","securityweek.com",{"url":42,"title":43,"date":38,"friendly_name":44,"website":45},"https://securityaffairs.co/171542/hacking/cyberattack-on-onsolve-codered.html","Emergency alerts go dark after cyberattack on OnSolve CodeRED","Security Affairs","securityaffairs.co",{"url":47,"title":48,"date":49,"friendly_name":50,"website":51},"https://www.databreaches.net/cyberattack-disables-onsolve-code-red-emergency-alert-system-across-st-louis-region/","Cyberattack disables Onsolve Code Red emergency alert system across St. Louis region","2025-11-22","DataBreaches.net","databreaches.net",{"url":53,"title":54,"date":55,"friendly_name":56,"website":57},"https://www.breached.co/nationwide-codered-emergency-alert-system-compromised-inc-ransom-attack-leaves-thousands-without-critical-communication/","Nationwide CodeRED Emergency Alert System Compromised: INC Ransom Attack Leaves Thousands Without Critical Communication","2025-11-23","Breached","breached.co",[59,62,65],{"datetime":60,"summary":61},"2025-11-01","Inc Ransom claims to have first gained access to OnSolve's systems.",{"datetime":63,"summary":64},"2025-11-10","Inc Ransom deploys file-encrypting ransomware on the CodeRED platform.",{"datetime":49,"summary":66},"Inc Ransom lists OnSolve on its dark web leak site, claiming responsibility for the attack.",[68,72,76,79,83,86],{"id":69,"name":70,"tactic":71},"T1486","Data Encrypted for Impact","Impact",{"id":73,"name":74,"tactic":75},"T1048","Exfiltration Over Alternative Medium","Exfiltration",{"id":77,"name":78,"tactic":71},"T1490","Inhibit System Recovery",{"id":80,"name":81,"tactic":82},"T1078","Valid Accounts","Initial Access",{"id":84,"name":85,"tactic":82},"T1190","Exploit Public-Facing Application",{"id":87,"name":88,"tactic":89},"T1003","OS Credential Dumping","Credential Access",[91,101,114,122],{"id":92,"name":93,"d3fend_techniques":94,"description":99,"domain":100},"M1051","Update Software",[95],{"id":96,"name":97,"url":98},"D3-SU","Software Update","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SoftwareUpdate","Regularly patch software, especially on internet-facing systems, to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.","enterprise",{"id":102,"name":103,"d3fend_techniques":104,"description":113,"domain":100},"M1030","Network Segmentation",[105,109],{"id":106,"name":107,"url":108},"D3-NI","Network Isolation","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkIsolation",{"id":110,"name":111,"url":112},"D3-ITF","Inbound Traffic Filtering","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:InboundTrafficFiltering","Segment networks to contain breaches and prevent lateral movement from less secure environments to critical systems.",{"id":115,"name":116,"d3fend_techniques":117,"description":121,"domain":100},"M1032","Multi-factor Authentication",[118],{"id":119,"name":116,"url":120},"D3-MFA","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:Multi-factorAuthentication","Enforce MFA on all remote access points, administrative accounts, and critical applications to prevent credential abuse.",{"id":123,"name":124,"d3fend_techniques":125,"description":130,"domain":100},"M1026","Privileged Account Management",[126],{"id":127,"name":128,"url":129},"D3-LAM","Local Account Monitoring","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:LocalAccountMonitoring","Implement strict controls over privileged accounts to limit their use and monitor for suspicious activity.",[132,138,141],{"technique_id":133,"technique_name":134,"url":135,"recommendation":136,"mitre_mitigation_id":137},"D3-FR","File Restoration","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:FileRestoration","In the context of the CodeRED ransomware attack, having a robust file restoration capability is the most critical recovery control. Organizations must implement a 3-2-1 backup strategy: three copies of data, on two different media, with one copy off-site and immutable or air-gapped. For a critical service like CodeRED, this means regular, automated backups of the application servers, databases, and user data. Restoration procedures must be tested quarterly at a minimum to validate data integrity and ensure recovery time objectives (RTOs) can be met. Since Inc Ransom also exfiltrates data, restoration alone is insufficient, but it is the only way to regain operational control without paying the ransom. The need to decommission the legacy platform suggests either backups were unavailable, corrupted, or the underlying infrastructure was too compromised to restore safely, underscoring the importance of testing and securing the backup environment itself.","M1053",{"technique_id":106,"technique_name":107,"url":108,"recommendation":139,"mitre_mitigation_id":140},"To prevent an incident like the OnSolve breach from escalating, network isolation is a key strategic defense. The CodeRED platform should have been in a highly segmented network zone, isolated from the general corporate IT environment. This involves configuring firewalls and network access control lists (ACLs) to strictly limit communication to and from the CodeRED servers. Only specific, authorized systems should be able to communicate with the platform on designated ports and protocols. This would have made it significantly harder for attackers to move laterally from a potentially compromised entry point (like an employee workstation) to the critical emergency alert infrastructure. Post-incident, as Crisis24 migrates customers, they must build the new environment with a zero-trust architecture, assuming no implicit trust between network segments and enforcing strict verification for any access request.","M1035",{"technique_id":142,"technique_name":143,"url":144,"recommendation":145,"mitre_mitigation_id":146},"D3-OTF","Outbound Traffic Filtering","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:OutboundTrafficFiltering","The exfiltration of user data by Inc Ransom could have been detected or blocked with effective outbound traffic filtering. Critical servers, like those running CodeRED, should be subject to egress filtering rules that deny all outbound traffic by default, only allowing connections to known, legitimate destinations required for operations (e.g., specific update servers, partner APIs). By monitoring for large, unexpected data transfers or connections to suspicious IP ranges or cloud storage providers not used by the organization, security teams can create high-fidelity alerts for potential data theft. Implementing this on perimeter firewalls and web proxies can serve as a last line of defense to disrupt the 'double extortion' component of modern ransomware attacks, even if the initial intrusion is successful.","M1037",[],[149,154,159],{"type":150,"value":151,"description":152,"context":153,"confidence":16},"command_line_pattern","vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet","Common command used by
