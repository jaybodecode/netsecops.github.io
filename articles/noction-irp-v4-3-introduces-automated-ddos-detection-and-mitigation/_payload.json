This capability uses behavior-based traffic analysis to rapidly identify DDoS attacks and other network anomalies. Once an attack is detected, the platform can automatically trigger mitigation actions using routing-native mechanisms like BGP FlowSpec or Remote Triggered Blackholing (RTBH), enabling network operators to respond to threats in seconds without relying on external systems.","## Executive Summary\n**[Noction](https://www.noction.com/)**, a provider of BGP network performance automation, has launched version 4.3 of its Intelligent Routing Platform (IRP). The flagship feature of this release is Automatic Anomaly Detection (AAD), a system designed to provide rapid, automated detection and mitigation of **[DDoS attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack)**. By analyzing network traffic telemetry (NetFlow, sFlow), AAD establishes a baseline of normal behavior and can detect deviations indicative of an attack within seconds. Upon detection, Noction IRP can initiate routing-based mitigation techniques such as BGP FlowSpec or Remote Triggered Blackholing (RTBH), allowing network operators and service providers to neutralize threats at the network edge with minimal latency and operational overhead.\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe AAD feature is designed to detect a wide range of volumetric and protocol-based DDoS attacks, including:\n- **TCP Floods:** SYN floods, ACK floods, FIN floods.\n- **UDP Floods:** Including amplification/reflection attacks like DNS amplification and NTP amplification.\n- **ICMP Floods:** Such as Smurf attacks and ping floods.\n- **Application-Layer Floods:** HTTP(S) floods targeting web servers.\n- **Protocol-Specific Floods:** SSH floods, etc.\n\nThese attacks aim to exhaust the network bandwidth, processing power, or session capacity of a target system, rendering it unavailable to legitimate users. The speed of modern DDoS attacks requires an automated detection and mitigation response, as manual intervention is often too slow.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nNoction IRP's new capability integrates threat detection directly into the network's routing control plane.\n\n### Detection Mechanism\n1.  **Telemetry Collection:** The IRP ingests traffic data from routers using standard protocols like `NetFlow`, `sFlow`, `IPFIX`, or `jFlow`.\n2.  **Behavioral Analysis:** The AAD engine continuously analyzes this telemetry to build a dynamic baseline of normal traffic patterns for different network prefixes.\n3.  **Anomaly Detection:** When incoming traffic deviates significantly from the established baseline (e.g., a sudden spike in UDP packets to a specific host), the system flags it as an anomaly.\n\n### Mitigation Mechanism\nOnce an anomaly is confirmed as a likely attack, the IRP can trigger one or more automated mitigation actions:\n- **[`BGP FlowSpec`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGP_Flowspec):** The IRP can generate and announce a BGP FlowSpec rule to upstream providers or internal routers. This rule instructs the routers to drop or rate-limit the specific malicious traffic pattern (e.g., 'drop all UDP traffic from source port 53 to destination IP X.X.X.X'). This is a highly granular mitigation that can block attack traffic without affecting legitimate traffic.\n- **Remote Triggered Blackholing (RTBH):** For large-scale volumetric attacks, the IRP can announce a BGP route that directs all traffic destined for the target IP to a null interface (a 'blackhole'). This sacrifices the target's connectivity but protects the rest of the network from collateral damage. This is a direct implementation of MITRE ATT&CK's **[`T1499.003 - Network Denial of Service`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/003/)** defense.\n\nOperators can configure the system for fully automated mitigation or a moderated mode that requires human approval before action is taken.\n\n## Impact Assessment\n- **Rapid Response Time:** By automating the detect-to-mitigate lifecycle, Noction IRP can respond to DDoS attacks in seconds, significantly reducing the time to mitigation and minimizing service disruption.\n- **Reduced Operational Overhead:** The automation frees network operations center (NOC) engineers from the manual task of analyzing traffic and crafting mitigation rules during a high-stress attack scenario.\n- **Cost-Effective Mitigation:** It leverages existing routing infrastructure and protocols (BGP), reducing the need for expensive, dedicated DDoS scrubbing appliances for certain classes of attacks.\n- **Enhanced Network Resilience:** The platform's ability to also monitor physical interface capacity and adjust traffic routing accordingly prevents overcommitment and improves overall network stability during outages or attacks.\n\n## Mitigation and Security Value\nThe primary value of Noction IRP v4.3 is its ability to provide an integrated, routing-native DDoS defense solution. It acts as both a detection engine and a response orchestrator. For Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and large enterprises that manage their own BGP routing, this solution offers a powerful tool to enhance their network's resilience against common volumetric DDoS attacks, directly contributing to the **[Network Intrusion Prevention](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1031/)** mitigation strategy.","Noction releases IRP v4.3 with Automatic Anomaly Detection! 🛡️ The new feature provides rapid, automated DDoS detection & mitigation using routing-native tools like BGP FlowSpec and RTBH to protect networks at the edge. #DDoS #BGP #NetOps #CyberSecurity","Noction has released IRP v4.3, featuring Automatic Anomaly Detection (AAD) for rapid identification and mitigation of DDoS attacks using BGP FlowSpec and RTBH.",[13,14,15],"Cyberattack","Security Operations","Patch Management","informational",[18,22,25,28,30],{"name":19,"type":20,"url":21},"Noction","vendor","https://www.noction.com/",{"name":23,"type":24},"Intelligent Routing Platform (IRP)","product",{"name":26,"type":27},"BGP FlowSpec","technology",{"name":29,"type":27},"Remote Triggered Blackholing (RTBH)",{"name":31,"type":32},"DDoS","malware",[],[35,41,47,50],{"url":36,"title":37,"date":38,"friendly_name":39,"website":40},"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260113005086/en/Noction-Releases-IRP-v4.3-with-Automatic-Anomaly-Detection-and-Enhanced-Bandwidth-Control-Capabilities","Noction Releases IRP v4.3 with Automatic Anomaly Detection and Enhanced Bandwidth Control Capabilities","2026-01-13","Business Wire","businesswire.com",{"url":42,"title":43,"date":44,"friendly_name":45,"website":46},"https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2026/01/16/new-infosec-products-of-the-week-january-16-2026/","New infosec products of the week: January 16, 2026","2026-01-16","Help Net Security","helpnetsecurity.com",{"url":48,"title":49,"date":38,"friendly_name":45,"website":46},"https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2026/01/13/noction-irp-4-3/","Noction adds automatic anomaly detection to IRP v4.3 for faster DDoS mitigation",{"url":51,"title":52,"date":53,"friendly_name":19,"website":54},"https://www.noction.com/blog/automatic-anomaly-detection-in-noction-irp","Automatic Anomaly Detection (AAD) in Noction IRP - Deep Dive","2026-01-12","noction.com",[],[57,61],{"id":58,"name":59,"tactic":60},"T1499.003","Network Denial of Service","Impact",{"id":62,"name":59,"tactic":60},"T1498",[64,78],{"id":65,"name":66,"d3fend_techniques":67,"description":76,"domain":77},"M1031","Network Intrusion Prevention",[68,72],{"id":69,"name":70,"url":71},"D3-ITF","Inbound Traffic Filtering","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:InboundTrafficFiltering",{"id":73,"name":74,"url":75},"D3-NTA","Network Traffic Analysis","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkTrafficAnalysis","Noction IRP acts as a network intrusion prevention system specifically for DDoS attacks by analyzing traffic and applying filtering rules via BGP.","enterprise",{"id":79,"name":80,"d3fend_techniques":81,"description":86,"domain":77},"M1037","Filter Network Traffic",[82],{"id":83,"name":84,"url":85},"D3-NI","Network Isolation","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkIsolation","The use of BGP FlowSpec and RTBH are direct methods of filtering malicious network traffic at the edge.",[88,90],{"technique_id":73,"technique_name":74,"url":75,"recommendation":89,"mitre_mitigation_id":65},"The core of Noction's new feature is its implementation of Network Traffic Analysis. Network operators should configure their edge routers to export NetFlow or sFlow data to the Noction IRP instance. The platform will then automatically baseline traffic for all advertised prefixes. The key tactical action is to fine-tune the sensitivity thresholds within the AAD module. Start with a more conservative setting to avoid false positives, and gradually tighten the thresholds as you gain confidence in the baseline. This allows the system to accurately detect anomalous traffic patterns, such as the high-volume, high-packet-rate floods typical of DDoS attacks, providing the trigger for automated mitigation.",{"technique_id":69,"technique_name":70,"url":71,"recommendation":91,"mitre_mitigation_id":65},"Noction IRP operationalizes Inbound Traffic Filtering at scale using BGP. Once AAD detects an attack, operators should configure the IRP to automatically generate and announce a BGP FlowSpec rule.

This is a highly precise filter that removes the attack traffic at the network edge, often within the upstream provider's network, before it can consume local bandwidth. For very large attacks that threaten to saturate the upstream link itself, the IRP should be configured to use RTBH, which sacrifices the targeted IP to protect the entire network.
