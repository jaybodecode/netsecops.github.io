According to Google's Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), the group has ceased using LOSTKEYS and is now actively using a new toolset, including the NOROBOT DLL and a PowerShell backdoor called MAYBEROBOT, to target high-value individuals such as NGOs, policy advisors, and dissidents.","## Executive Summary\n**[COLDRIVER](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1016/)** (also tracked as Star Blizzard, UNC4057, and Callisto), a Russian state-sponsored threat actor, has shown significant resilience and agility by rapidly retooling its operations following public disclosure. According to **[Google's Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG)](https://cloud.google.com/threat-intelligence)**, just five days after its **LOSTKEYS** malware was detailed in a public report in May 2025, the group deployed a new malicious DLL named **NOROBOT**. This new tool was used to deliver a flexible PowerShell-based backdoor, **MAYBEROBOT**, in campaigns targeting high-value individuals relevant to Russian state interests, including NGOs, policy advisors, and dissidents. This rapid pivot demonstrates the group's ability to quickly adapt its toolset to evade detection and sustain its intelligence collection objectives.\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe campaign highlights **COLDRIVER**'s operational tempo and iterative development process. After the public exposure of **LOSTKEYS**, the group immediately shifted to a new toolchain. The initial vector involved a \"ClickFix\" lure, a fake CAPTCHA that tricks the target into executing the malicious **NOROBOT** DLL. Early versions of **NOROBOT** (also independently named BAITSWITCH by **[Zscaler](https://www.zscaler.com/)**) were used to download a Python-based backdoor called **YESROBOT**. However, the group quickly abandoned this for the more versatile **MAYBEROBOT** PowerShell backdoor. Throughout the summer of 2025 (June-September), **COLDRIVER** continued to release multiple variants of **NOROBOT**, constantly modifying it to avoid detection by security products while continuing its espionage campaigns.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n**COLDRIVER**'s updated attack chain reflects a focus on evading signature-based detection:\n\n*   **Phishing and Lure:** [`T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002/). The campaign relies on tricking users into clicking links that lead to the \"ClickFix\" lure, which initiates the malware execution.\n*   **User Execution:** [`T1204.002 - Malicious File`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002/). The user is manipulated into running the malicious payload disguised as a CAPTCHA solver.\n*   **Execution:** [`T1059.001 - PowerShell`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/). The ultimate payload, **MAYBEROBOT**, is a PowerShell backdoor. Using PowerShell allows for fileless execution and makes it easier to blend in with legitimate administrative activity.\n*   **Defense Evasion:** The rapid iteration of **NOROBOT** variants is a clear attempt at defense evasion ([`T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/)). By constantly changing the malware's signatures, the group aims to stay ahead of antivirus and EDR detections.\n*   **Ingress Tool Transfer:** [`T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105/). The **NOROBOT** DLL's primary function is to download the next-stage payload (**MAYBEROBOT**) from a hardcoded C2 address.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe primary goal of **COLDRIVER** is intelligence collection. By targeting NGOs, policy advisors, and dissidents, the Russian government gains insight into policy-making, political opposition, and other areas of strategic interest. The compromise of these individuals' devices provides the attackers with access to sensitive communications, documents, and contact lists. The group's demonstrated ability to rapidly retool after public disclosure means they are a persistent and resilient threat, capable of maintaining access to targets even after their methods are exposed.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\nSecurity teams should hunt for signs of **COLDRIVER**'s new toolset:\n\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `file_name` | `NOROBOT.dll`, `BAITSWITCH.dll` | Hunt for the presence of these specific DLL files on disk. |\n| `command_line_pattern` | `powershell.exe -enc` or `powershell.exe -nop -w hidden` | Monitor for PowerShell execution with encoded commands or hidden windows, common indicators of malicious scripts. |\n| `log_source` | `PowerShell Script Block Logging (Event ID 4104)` | Enable and monitor PowerShell script block logging to capture the deobfuscated content of scripts like MAYBEROBOT. |\n| `network_traffic_pattern` | `Connections from powershell.exe to unknown IPs` | Monitor for network connections originating directly from PowerShell processes, especially to untrusted destinations. |\n\n## Detection & Response\n1.  **PowerShell Logging:** The most effective way to detect **MAYBEROBOT** is by enabling and monitoring PowerShell logging. Specifically, Script Block Logging (Event ID 4104) and Module Logging (Event ID 4103) should be forwarded to a SIEM. This allows security analysts to see the full, deobfuscated content of the PowerShell scripts being run, enabling the creation of high-fidelity detection rules based on the backdoor's functionality. This is a form of [`D3-PA: Process Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ProcessAnalysis).\n2.  **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Deploy an EDR solution to monitor for suspicious process chains, such as a browser or document reader spawning a process that ultimately executes a PowerShell script. The initial execution of the **NOROBOT** DLL should also be detectable.\n3.  **Email Security:** Use advanced email security gateways to block phishing emails containing the initial lures. Analyze URLs at time-of-click to protect users from the \"ClickFix\" lure. This aligns with [`D3-UA: URL Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:URLAnalysis).\n\n## Mitigation\n*   **User Training:** Since the attack relies on social engineering, training users to recognize and report phishing attempts is a critical first line of defense ([`M1017 - User Training`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1017/)).\n*   **PowerShell Hardening:** If PowerShell is not required for normal user operations, restrict its use via application control policies or use PowerShell Constrained Language Mode. This is a key part of [`D3-ACH: Application Configuration Hardening`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ApplicationConfigurationHardening).\n*   **Attack Surface Reduction (ASR):** Implement Microsoft Defender ASR rules to block common malicious behaviors, such as blocking executable content from email clients and webmail, and blocking Office applications from creating child processes.\n*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** While this attack focuses on malware execution, MFA on all external services remains a crucial control to prevent credential abuse if the malware successfully steals passwords.","🇷🇺 Russian APT COLDRIVER rapidly retooled after public disclosure, deploying new NOROBOT & MAYBEROBOT malware.
