The action, taken on October 6, 2025, confirms the flaw is being actively exploited in the wild. The vulnerability allows a local, authenticated attacker to execute code with SYSTEM-level privileges by leveraging a buffer overflow. The flaw affects a wide range of Windows versions, including Windows 10, 11, and Server editions. Federal agencies have been directed to patch the vulnerability by October 27, 2025.","## Executive Summary\nOn October 6, 2025, the U.S. **[Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov)** added **`CVE-2021-43226`** to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, signaling that the flaw is under active exploitation. This high-severity vulnerability is a privilege escalation bug in the **[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/security)** Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) Driver. It allows a local attacker who has already gained initial access to a system to elevate their privileges to `SYSTEM`, the highest level of authority on a Windows machine. The flaw impacts modern Windows operating systems, including Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server 2016/2019/2022. In accordance with Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01, CISA has mandated that all federal civilian agencies apply the necessary patches by October 27, 2025.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n**`CVE-2021-43226`** is a local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerability rooted in the Windows Common Log File System (`clfs.sys`). The flaw arises from the driver's failure to properly validate user-supplied metadata within a CLFS log file. An authenticated attacker can craft a malicious log file that, when processed, triggers a buffer overflow, leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the kernel.\n\n*   **Attack Vector**: Local\n*   **Complexity**: Low\n*   **Privileges Required**: Low (Authenticated User)\n*   **User Interaction**: None\n\nBecause the attack is local, a threat actor must first gain a foothold on the target system, typically through methods like phishing, malware infection, or exploiting a separate remote code execution vulnerability. Once on the system, this vulnerability provides a reliable pathway to full system control.\n\n## Affected Systems\nThe vulnerability affects a broad range of Microsoft Windows products, including:\n*   **[Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10)**\n*   **[Windows 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11)**\n*   **Windows Server 2016**\n*   **Windows Server 2019**\n*   **Windows Server 2022**\n\nThe availability of public proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code further increases the risk, as it lowers the barrier for less sophisticated actors to incorporate this exploit into their attacks.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nSuccessful exploitation of **`CVE-2021-43226`** grants an attacker `SYSTEM` privileges. This level of access is catastrophic, as it allows the threat actor to:\n*   Bypass all security controls on the endpoint (e.g., antivirus, EDR).\n*   Deploy persistent malware, such as rootkits or backdoors. ([`T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/))\n*   Dump credentials for other users and domain accounts, facilitating lateral movement across the network. ([`T1003 - OS Credential Dumping`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/))\n*   Install ransomware and destroy backups.\n*   Exfiltrate any data on the system.\n\nThis type of vulnerability is a crucial component in the attack chain for ransomware groups and APTs, who use it to escalate privileges after gaining an initial foothold.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\nDetecting exploitation of this vulnerability involves monitoring for suspicious interactions with the CLFS driver and subsequent privilege escalation activity.\n\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `file_name` | `*.blf` | Monitor for the creation or modification of unusual Base Log File (`.blf`) files, especially by low-privileged user processes. |\n| `process_name` | `svchost.exe` | Look for `svchost.exe` or other high-privilege processes spawning from unexpected parent processes like `explorer.exe` or `cmd.exe`. |\n| `event_id` | `4688` | In Windows Security Logs, hunt for process creation events where a low-privilege user process spawns a child process running with `SYSTEM` integrity. |\n| `log_source` | `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` | Kernel-level errors or unexpected reboots could be an indicator of a failed exploit attempt. |\n\n## Detection & Response\nSecurity teams should focus on endpoint monitoring to detect exploitation of this LPE flaw.\n\n### Detection Methods\n1.  **EDR Rules**: Configure EDR solutions to alert on processes that exhibit suspicious behavior related to CLFS, such as a non-system process writing to `.blf` files in system directories. Use D3FEND's [`Process Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ProcessAnalysis) to baseline normal process behavior.\n2.  **SIEM Correlation**: Create correlation rules in your SIEM to detect a chain of events, such as a user downloading a file from the internet, executing it, and that process subsequently spawning a new process with `SYSTEM` privileges.\n3.  **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**: Monitor for the creation of suspicious `.blf` files in temp directories or user profiles, as these may be used to stage the exploit.\n\n## Remediation Steps\nImmediate patching is the primary remediation for this vulnerability.\n\n1.  **Apply Patches**: Deploy the security updates released by Microsoft that address **`CVE-2021-43226`**. Prioritize patching for critical servers and systems accessible by a large number of users. This is a direct application of D3FEND's [`Software Update`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SoftwareUpdate).\n2.  **Vulnerability Scanning**: Run authenticated vulnerability scans to verify that the patch has been applied correctly and to identify any missed assets.\n3.  **Principle of Least Privilege**: As a general best practice, enforce the principle of least privilege for all user accounts. While this does not prevent the vulnerability's exploitation, it limits the opportunities for attackers to gain the initial foothold needed to run the local exploit. This relates to D3FEND's [`User Account Permissions`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:UserAccountPermissions).","CISA KEV UPDATE: A Windows privilege escalation flaw (CVE-2021-43226) in the CLFS Driver is being actively exploited.
