The incident exposed the data of users who had interacted with Discord's support channels. Hackers claim to have exfiltrated information from 5.5 million users, including usernames, email addresses, IP addresses, and the contents of support tickets. Discord has assured its community that sensitive data such as passwords and authentication tokens were not compromised. In response, Discord has revoked the vendor's system access and is in the process of notifying all affected individuals, highlighting the persistent risks associated with third-party supply chain security.","## Executive Summary\n**[Discord](https://discord.com)** has confirmed a limited data breach stemming from a security incident at a third-party support vendor, identified as **[Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com)**. While Discord states passwords and authentication tokens were not exposed, threat actors claim to have accessed the data of 5.5 million users, including emails, IP addresses, and the content of support tickets. This incident primarily affects users who have interacted with Discord's Trust & Safety or other support services. The breach underscores the significant risks posed by third-party vendors and the importance of robust supply chain security management. Discord has revoked the vendor's access and is notifying affected users.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe breach was not a direct compromise of Discord's core infrastructure but a **[supply chain attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack)** targeting one of its vendors. Threat actors gained unauthorized access to Discord's Zendesk customer support portal. By compromising this third-party platform, the attackers were able to access and exfiltrate data associated with user support requests. The exposed data includes personally identifiable information (PII) such as usernames and email addresses, as well as potentially sensitive conversations contained within support tickets. The attackers' claim of 5.5 million affected users, if accurate, represents a significant data leak that could be leveraged for targeted phishing campaigns, social engineering, and other malicious activities.\n\n---\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThe attack vector was the compromise of a trusted third-party relationship, a common tactic for bypassing an organization's primary security controls. The threat actors likely gained access to Discord's Zendesk instance through stolen credentials or by exploiting a vulnerability in the vendor's environment, though Zendesk denies the latter.\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK Techniques\n*   [`T1199 - Trusted Relationship`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199/): The attackers exploited the trusted relationship between Discord and its support vendor, Zendesk, to gain access to user data.\n*   [`T1078 - Valid Accounts`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/): The compromise likely involved the use of legitimate, albeit stolen, credentials for the third-party support platform.\n*   [`T1005 - Data from Local System`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005/): Attackers accessed and collected data stored within the Zendesk support portal, including support tickets and associated user information.\n*   [`T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041/): The stolen data was exfiltrated from the compromised support environment to attacker-controlled infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe primary impact on affected users is an increased risk of targeted phishing and social engineering attacks. With access to email addresses and the context of past support tickets, attackers can craft highly convincing fraudulent communications pretending to be from Discord support. This could lead to account takeovers if users are tricked into revealing their passwords or clicking on malicious links. For Discord, the incident carries reputational damage and erodes user trust, despite the breach originating from a third party. It also highlights operational dependencies and risks that require significant resources to investigate and remediate.\n\n---\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\nOrganizations should monitor for signs of compromised third-party accounts:\n\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| log_source | `Zendesk Audit Logs` | Monitor for anomalous login locations, times, or IP addresses for support agent accounts. |\n| log_source | `Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) Logs` | Look for unusual data access patterns or large data downloads from sanctioned cloud applications like Zendesk. |\n| network_traffic_pattern | `Unusual API activity` | Monitor API calls to and from third-party platforms for excessive data retrieval or unusual user agent strings. |\n\n---\n\n## Detection & Response\nDetecting this type of breach requires visibility into the activity of third-party services. \n\n1.  **Log Analysis**: Regularly ingest and analyze audit logs from critical third-party platforms like Zendesk. Implement SIEM rules to alert on suspicious activities, such as logins from geographically impossible locations, multiple failed login attempts followed by a success, or access from non-corporate IP addresses. This can be aided by **[D3-LAM: Local Account Monitoring](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:LocalAccountMonitoring)**.\n2.  **User Behavior Analytics (UBA)**: Deploy UBA solutions to baseline normal support agent activity. Deviations from this baseline, such as an agent accessing an unusually high number of tickets or exporting large volumes of data, should trigger an immediate alert.\n3.  **CASB Implementation**: A Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) can provide visibility and control over data in third-party SaaS applications. Configure policies to detect and block anomalous data exfiltration attempts.\n\nResponse actions should include immediate revocation of the compromised account's access, initiation of a forensic investigation with the third-party vendor, and prompt notification to affected users with clear guidance on how to protect themselves.\n\n---\n\n## Mitigation\nStrengthening security against third-party risks requires a multi-layered approach.\n\n1.  **Vendor Risk Management**: Implement a comprehensive third-party risk management program. This includes rigorous security assessments before onboarding vendors and periodic reviews of their security posture.\n2.  **Enforce MFA**: Mandate the use of **[Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](https://www.cisa.gov/mfa)** for all accounts with access to corporate data, especially third-party service portals. This is a key aspect of **[D3-MFA: Multi-factor Authentication](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:Multi-factorAuthentication)**.\n3.  **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure that third-party vendors and their employees have access only to the data and systems absolutely necessary for their function. Regularly review and prune these permissions.\n4.  **Contractual Obligations**: Include specific security requirements, breach notification timelines, and rights to audit in all third-party contracts.","⚠️ Discord confirms data breach via a third-party support vendor!

For this specific Discord incident, had MFA been enforced on the vendor's support accounts, a simple credential compromise would have been insufficient for attackers to gain access. Implementation should prioritize strong MFA methods such as FIDO2 security keys or time-based one-time password (TOTP) apps over less secure methods like SMS. This policy should be contractually mandated for all third-party vendors and regularly audited for compliance. Deploying a Single Sign-On (SSO) solution with conditional access policies can further strengthen this control by restricting access based on location, device health, and time of day, providing a robust defense against unauthorized access to critical cloud-based support portals.",{"technique_id":108,"technique_name":109,"url":110,"recommendation":111,"mitre_mitigation_id":112},"D3-UAP","User Account Permissions","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:UserAccountPermissions","To mitigate the impact of a third-party breach like the one affecting Discord, organizations must strictly enforce the principle of least privilege through robust User Account Permissions.

For example, access to view or export bulk user data should be highly restricted or disabled entirely for standard support roles. Regular access reviews, conducted quarterly, are essential to identify and remove excessive permissions. By minimizing the access scope of each vendor account, the potential 'blast radius' of a single account compromise is significantly reduced, preventing attackers from accessing a large dataset of 5.5 million users.","M1015",[],[115,120,126],{"type":116,"value":117,"description":118,"context":119,"confidence":16},"log_source","Third-party application audit logs (e.g., Zendesk)","Audit logs from
