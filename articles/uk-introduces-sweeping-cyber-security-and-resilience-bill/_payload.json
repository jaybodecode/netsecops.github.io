This new bill significantly expands the regulatory landscape by bringing Managed Service Providers (MSPs) into scope for the first time, a move impacting up to 1,100 firms. It also imposes stricter incident reporting rules, requiring an initial report within 24 hours and a full report within 72 hours. The legislation aims to bolster national security by strengthening supply chain resilience and aligning the UK with updated international standards like the EU's NIS2 Directive.","## Executive Summary\nThe **[United Kingdom](https://www.gov.uk/)** government has introduced the Cyber Security and Resilience Bill, a major legislative overhaul designed to replace the 2018 Network and Information Systems (NIS) Regulations. This bill represents a significant step-up in the UK's approach to national cybersecurity, aiming to protect critical infrastructure and the wider economy. Key provisions include bringing Managed Service Providers (MSPs) under regulatory scrutiny for the first time, imposing stringent two-stage incident reporting deadlines (24 hours for initial notification, 72 hours for a full report), and mandating that Operators of Essential Services (OES) manage their supply chain risks more effectively. The bill aligns the UK with stricter international standards, such as the EU's NIS2 Directive, and empowers regulators to designate critical suppliers who must meet minimum security standards.\n\n---\n\n## Regulatory Details\nThe Cyber Security and Resilience Bill introduces several fundamental changes to the UK's cybersecurity legal framework.\n\n### Scope Expansion\n- **Managed Service Providers (MSPs):** For the first time, MSPs will be brought into the regulatory scope. This is a critical change, recognizing that MSPs can be a significant vector for supply chain attacks. The government estimates this will affect between 900 and 1,100 additional firms.\n- **Critical Suppliers:** Regulators will be granted the authority to designate specific suppliers as 'critical'. These designated entities will be required to comply with a set of minimum security standards, directly addressing risks posed by single points of failure in the digital supply chain.\n\n### New Incident Reporting Mandates\n- **Two-Stage Reporting:** The bill scraps the previous, more lenient reporting timelines. It introduces a strict two-stage process:\n    1.  **Initial Report:** No later than 24 hours after an incident is discovered.\n    2.  **Full Report:** A detailed follow-up report must be submitted within 72 hours.\n- **Customer Notification:** Digital service providers and data center providers will be legally required to notify their customers directly in the event of a breach that affects them.\n\n### Enhanced Security Duties\n- **Supply Chain Risk Management:** Operators of Essential Services (OES) will have a legal duty to manage risks within their supply chains. This requires them to assess the security posture of their key suppliers.\n- **Updated Security Requirements:** OES will need to adhere to updated security measures based on the National Cyber Security Centre's (NCSC) Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF).\n\n---\n\n## Affected Organizations\n- **Operators of Essential Services (OES):** Organizations in critical sectors such as energy, transport, water, health, and digital infrastructure will face more stringent requirements.\n- **Managed Service Providers (MSPs):** A wide range of IT service providers, including those offering managed security, cloud hosting, and IT outsourcing, will now be regulated.\n- **Digital and Data Center Providers:** These entities will have new obligations regarding customer notification.\n- **Designated Critical Suppliers:** Any company designated as critical by UK regulators will have to meet the new security standards.\n\n---\n\n## Compliance Requirements\nOrganizations falling under the bill's scope will need to undertake significant efforts to ensure compliance:\n\n1.  **Security Framework Alignment:** Review and update internal security policies and controls to align with the NCSC's CAF.\n2.  **Incident Response Planning:** Revise incident response plans to meet the new 24/72-hour reporting deadlines. This requires having processes and personnel in place to quickly assess, contain, and report on incidents.\n3.  **Supply Chain Due Diligence:** Implement a formal program for third-party risk management. This includes conducting security assessments of MSPs and other critical suppliers and embedding security requirements into contracts.\n4.  **Asset Management:** While not explicitly detailed in the summary, complying with these rules implicitly requires a robust asset management program to understand what systems are critical and who manages them.\n\n---\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe bill will have a profound operational and financial impact on affected organizations. MSPs will face new compliance costs associated with implementing and demonstrating required security controls. OES will need to invest in their supply chain risk management programs, which may involve hiring new staff and purchasing specialized tools. The stricter reporting deadlines will put significant pressure on security and incident response teams, requiring well-drilled procedures and potentially 24/7 on-call capabilities. The **[Association of British Insurers (ABI)](https://www.abi.org.uk/)** has welcomed the bill, noting that the insurance industry paid out nearly £200 million in cyber claims last year, highlighting the economic necessity of these enhanced measures.\n\n---\n\n## Compliance Guidance\n1.  **Conduct a Gap Analysis:** Immediately perform a gap analysis comparing your current security posture against the NCSC's CAF and the likely requirements of the new bill.\n2.  **Review MSP Contracts:** Begin reviewing contracts with all MSPs and critical suppliers. Identify where security clauses need to be strengthened to ensure they can meet their new obligations.\n3.  **Drill Incident Response:** Conduct tabletop exercises and drills simulating a cyber incident to test your ability to meet the 24-hour initial reporting deadline. Identify any gaps in your process, technology, or team structure.\n4.  **Engage Legal Counsel:** Work with legal and compliance teams to understand the full scope of the legislation and its implications for your business, including potential penalties for non-compliance.","🇬🇧 The UK has introduced a new Cyber Security & Resilience Bill.
