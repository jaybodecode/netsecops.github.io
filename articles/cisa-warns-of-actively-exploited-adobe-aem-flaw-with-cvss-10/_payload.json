The flaw, which carries a perfect 10.0 CVSS score, allows for unauthenticated arbitrary code execution and is being actively exploited in the wild. CISA has added it to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, mandating federal agencies to patch by November 5, 2025. The vulnerability stems from a misconfiguration in JEE versions of AEM that exposes a debug servlet, allowing attackers to achieve full system compromise.","## Executive Summary\nA critical, unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, **[CVE-2025-54253](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54253)**, in **[Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/)** Experience Manager (AEM) Forms is being actively exploited in the wild. The vulnerability has been assigned the maximum possible CVSS score of 10.0, reflecting its extreme severity. Due to confirmed exploitation, the **[U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov)** has added it to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. This action requires U.S. federal agencies to remediate the flaw by November 5, 2025. The vulnerability allows a remote attacker with no credentials to take complete control of a vulnerable server. All organizations using the affected versions of AEM Forms on JEE are urged to apply the available patches immediately as a top priority.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\nThe vulnerability exists in the Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) versions of Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Forms, specifically versions 6.5.23.0 and earlier. The root cause is a critical misconfiguration that exposes a debug servlet at the URL path `/adminui/debug`.\n\nThis servlet was likely intended for internal development or troubleshooting purposes but was improperly left exposed in production builds without any authentication controls. An attacker can send a specially crafted request to this endpoint containing arbitrary Java code. The servlet will then evaluate and execute this code with the privileges of the AEM application, leading to a full system compromise.\n\nThis attack vector is classified as an [`T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/), as it targets a component accessible over the network without any prior access or credentials.\n\n## Affected Systems\n-   **Product:** Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Forms on Java Enterprise Edition (JEE)\n-   **Affected Versions:** 6.5.23.0 and earlier\n\n## Exploitation Status\n-   **Active Exploitation:** CISA has confirmed that **[CVE-2025-54253](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54253)** is being actively exploited by malicious actors.\n-   **CISA KEV Catalog:** The vulnerability was added to the KEV catalog, indicating a high-priority threat to federal networks and, by extension, all organizations.\n-   **Remediation Deadline:** Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are mandated to patch by November 5, 2025, under Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nExploitation of this vulnerability is trivial and the impact is catastrophic. A successful attacker can:\n-   Execute arbitrary code on the underlying server with the permissions of the AEM service account.\n-   Steal sensitive data processed by the AEM Forms application.\n-   Deploy malware, such as ransomware or backdoors, for long-term persistence.\n-   Use the compromised server as a pivot point to move laterally within the victim's network.\n-   Cause a complete denial of service.\n\nGiven the perfect 10.0 CVSS score, this vulnerability represents a worst-case scenario for a public-facing application.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| url_pattern | `/adminui/debug` | The presence of requests to this URL path in web server logs is a high-confidence indicator of compromise or an exploitation attempt. |\n| process_name | `java.exe` | Monitor the `java.exe` process associated with the AEM application for suspicious child processes (e.g., `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `/bin/bash`). |\n| log_source | `AEM Error Logs` | Check AEM's internal error logs for exceptions or messages related to the execution of unexpected code. |\n\n## Detection Methods\n-   **Log Analysis ([D3-NTA: Network Traffic Analysis](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkTrafficAnalysis)):** The most effective detection method is to search web server access logs (e.g., Apache, IIS, Nginx) for any HTTP requests containing the string `/adminui/debug`. Any hits should be considered a security incident and investigated immediately.\n-   **EDR Monitoring:** Use an Endpoint Detection and Response tool to monitor the Java process running the AEM application. Create alerts for the spawning of shell processes or network connections to unusual IP addresses.\n-   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a vulnerability scanner with up-to-date plugins to actively check for the presence of **[CVE-2025-54253](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54253)** in your environment.\n\n## Remediation Steps\n1.  **Patch Immediately ([D3-SU: Software Update](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SoftwareUpdate)):** The primary and most effective solution is to apply the security patches released by Adobe in early October 2025. This should be treated as an emergency change.\n2.  **Workaround (Temporary):** If patching is not immediately possible, implement a rule on a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or the front-end web server to block all access to the `/adminui/` URL path. This should only be considered a temporary compensating control until the patch can be applied.\n3.  **System Isolation:** Isolate vulnerable AEM servers from the internet if they do not need to be publicly accessible. Restrict access to only trusted internal IP ranges.\n4.  **Hunt for Compromise:** After applying mitigations, assume compromise and hunt for indicators of malicious activity using the detection methods described above.","🚨 CRITICAL FLAW: CISA warns of an actively exploited Adobe AEM Forms vulnerability (CVE-2025-54253) with a perfect 10.0 CVSS score!

This rule should be deployed in 'block' mode immediately.
