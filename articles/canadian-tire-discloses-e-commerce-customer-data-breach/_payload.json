Discloses Data Breach Impacting Online Customers of Canadian Tire, SportChek, and Mark's","Canadian Tire Corp., a major Canadian retail conglomerate, has reported a data breach affecting its e-commerce customers. Discovered on October 2, 2025, the incident involved unauthorized access to a single database serving multiple brands, including Canadian Tire, SportChek, Mark's/L'Équipeur, and Party City. The exposed data includes customer names, addresses, email addresses, and years of birth. The company stated that financial data and its Triangle Rewards loyalty program were not impacted. For a subset of fewer than 150,000 customers whose full birth dates were exposed, Canadian Tire is offering complimentary credit monitoring services.","## Executive Summary\n**[Canadian Tire](https://www.canadiantire.ca/)** Corp., one of Canada's largest retailers, has publicly disclosed a data breach that exposed the personal information of its online customers. The company identified the unauthorized access on October 2, 2025, which was limited to a single e-commerce database. This database supported online accounts for several of its prominent retail banners: Canadian Tire, **[SportChek](https://www.sportchek.ca/)**, **[Mark's/L'Équipeur](https://www.marks.com/)**, and **[Party City](https://www.partycity.ca/)**. The breach did not compromise financial information, such as full credit card numbers, or the company's Triangle Rewards loyalty program. The primary risk to affected customers is from follow-on phishing and identity theft campaigns.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\nAn unknown threat actor gained unauthorized access to a customer database associated with the company's e-commerce operations. The breach was contained to this specific database and did not impact in-store systems or the Canadian Tire Bank. The company has not disclosed the initial access vector or the duration of the unauthorized access.\n\nThe compromised information includes:\n-   Customer names\n-   Mailing addresses\n-   Email addresses\n-   Years of birth\n-   Encrypted passwords\n-   Truncated credit card numbers (not usable for transactions)\n\nFor a smaller group of fewer than 150,000 customers, full dates of birth were also exposed. These individuals are being notified directly and offered credit monitoring services.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nWhile technical details are scarce, the incident points to a compromise of a web-facing database or an application with access to it. The exposure of encrypted passwords suggests the actor may have exfiltrated the entire user table. Even though the passwords are encrypted, a weak hashing algorithm could allow the threat actor to crack them offline, enabling potential credential stuffing attacks against other services where customers may have reused passwords. The primary value of the stolen data lies in its utility for creating highly convincing, targeted phishing campaigns ([`T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002/)).\n\n## Impact Assessment\nAffected customers are now at an increased risk of social engineering attacks. Threat actors can use the combination of name, email, address, and birth date information to craft personalized phishing emails that appear legitimate, potentially tricking victims into revealing more sensitive information like passwords or financial details. For the ~150,000 customers whose full birth dates were exposed, the risk of identity theft is elevated. The incident also carries reputational damage for the Canadian Tire family of brands and underscores the persistent targeting of large retail databases by cybercriminals.\n\n## IOCs\nNo Indicators of Compromise have been released.\n\n## Detection & Response\n-   **For Affected Customers:** Be extremely vigilant for unsolicited emails, texts, or phone calls claiming to be from Canadian Tire, SportChek, Mark's, or Party City. Do not click on links or provide personal information in response to such communications. Verify any requests by contacting the company through its official website or customer service number.\n-   **For the Organization:** Canadian Tire has engaged external cybersecurity experts to investigate and strengthen its security posture. The incident has been reported to the relevant privacy regulators.\n\n## Mitigation\n-   **Password Reset:** Although not explicitly stated by the company, it is highly recommended that all affected customers proactively change their passwords for their Canadian Tire, SportChek, Mark's, and Party City online accounts.\n-   **Credit Monitoring:** The subset of customers whose full birth dates were exposed should take advantage of the credit monitoring services being offered to detect any fraudulent activity.\n-   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Customers should enable **[MFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication)** on their retail accounts if the option is available. This provides a critical layer of security even if a password is compromised.\n-   **D3FEND Techniques:** From an organizational perspective, implementing countermeasures like [`D3-SPP: Strong Password Policy`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:StrongPasswordPolicy) (including strong hashing algorithms) and [`D3-RAPA: Resource Access Pattern Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ResourceAccessPatternAnalysis) can help prevent and detect such breaches.","Canadian Tire reports a data breach affecting e-commerce customers across its brands, including SportChek & Mark's. 🛒 Personal info like names, emails, and addresses exposed.

This involves establishing a baseline of normal access patterns: which applications and service accounts query the database, from which IP addresses, at what times, and how much data they typically retrieve. A threat actor gaining access and attempting to exfiltrate the entire customer table would likely generate a significant deviation from this baseline—a large query from an unusual source or at an odd time. SIEM or database activity monitoring (DAM) tools can be configured to alert on these anomalies, enabling security teams to detect and respond to the breach before the data leaves the network.","M1040",{"technique_id":88,"technique_name":89,"url":90,"recommendation":91,"mitre_mitigation_id":92},"D3-MFA","Multi-factor Authentication","https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:Multi-factorAuthentication","While not a preventative measure for the database theft itself, offering and encouraging Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is the single most effective control to mitigate the impact of compromised credentials.

Even if an attacker cracks a password, they would still be blocked by the second factor. For any e-commerce platform, MFA should be a standard security feature offered to all users to protect their accounts, purchase history, and stored personal information.","M1032",[],[95,101],{"type":96,"value":97,"description":98,"context":99,"confidence":100},"other","Phishing emails impersonating Canadian Tire brands","A likely follow-up to this breach will be phishing campaigns using the stolen PII to target customers.","Email security gateways, user-reported phishing.","high",{"type":102,"value":103,"description":104,"context":105,"confidence":15},"user_account_pattern","Credential stuffing attempts using breached email/password pairs","Attackers may attempt to use the compromised credentials on other websites.","Authentication logs on various online services, looking for high-volume failed logins from specific IPs.",[13,107,108,109,110,111],"Retail","PII","Canadian Tire","Canada","E-commerce","2025-10-15T15:00:00.000Z","NewsArticle",{"geographic_scope":115,"companies_affected":116,"countries_affected":117,"industries_affected":118,"people_affected_estimate":119},"national",[18,21,23,25],[110],[107],"Fewer than 150,000 customers had full birth dates exposed; total number affected is larger.",4,{"articles":122,"totalCount":3599,"lastUpdated":3600},[123,143,162,179,192,214,229,240,253,264,275,289,305,318,327,339,351,365,378,387,401,412,421,432,443,462,475,490,505,518,534,549,569,580,593,609,624,637,648,662,676,690,703,720,735,749,764,777,791,803,819,830,841,852,865,878,890,899,912,922,932,944,957,970,984,996,1006,1018,1032,1044,1053,1066,1080,1089,1100,1114,1125,1135,1147,1163,1174,1187,1198,1210,1220,1232,1244,1254,1266,1277,1288,1299,1308,1319,1333,1344,1352,1365,1373,1383,1393,1407,1417,1426,1440,1451,1467,1480,1492,1505,1517,1530,1545,1558,1568,1582,1591,1602,1615,1629,1641,1651,1664,1674,1685,1697,1710,1728,1738,1748,1759,1772,1786,1797,1810,1820,1831,1842,1852,1865,1877,1890,1903,1913,1925,1937,1951,1961,1973,1985,1997,2011,2022,2032,2043,2055,2066,2076,2089,2098,2109,2123,2133,2146,2154,2165,2176,2188,2197,2208,2220,2233,2246,2257,2272,2285,2295,2306,2316,2325,2335,2350,2362,2375,2385,2396,2407,2418,2430,2441,2454,2465,2480,2491,2505,2518,2530,2539,2551,2563,2572,2583,2594,2606,2617,2627,2641,2652,2664,2675,2688,2699,2713,2724,2736,2747,2758,2768,2778,2789,2800,2810,2822,2834,2848,2857,2870,2881,2892,2901,2911,2915,2925,2936,2947,2959,2969,2979,2991,3001,3015,3027,3037,3047,3056,3067,3077,3087,3100,3110,3120,3133,3143,3154,3165,3177,3189,3201,3211,3222,3234,3244,3255,3265,3275,3285,3294,3304,3316,3330,3340,3353,3363,3374,3383,3393,3403,3412,3421,3430,3441,3450,3461,3471,3482,3490,3499,3509,3519,3529,3540,3550,3561,3569,3578,3588],{"id":124,"slug":125,"headline":126,"title":127,"severity":100,"article_type":113,"excerpt":128,"tags":129,"categories":136,"createdAt":139,"updatedAt":139,"displayDate":140,"isUpdated":141,"readingTime":142},"1500e788-fe3c-47f4-af1b-60548a85718d","shinyhunters-implicated-in-salesforce-data-breach-via-gainsight-app","ShinyHunters Hits Salesforce Again, Breaching Customers via Gainsight App","ShinyHunters Implicated in Major Salesforce Data Breach Through Compromised Gainsight Third-Party Application","Salesforce has disclosed a significant data breach affecting its customers, stemming from a compromised connection with the Gainsight customer success application.
