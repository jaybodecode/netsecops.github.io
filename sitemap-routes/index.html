class="text-gray-400 text-sm mb-2">The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) has issued new guidance for financial institutions, emphasizing their ultimate accountability for managing cybersecurity risks originating from third-party service providers (TPSPs). The regulator warned that as firms increasingly rely on cloud computing, AI, and fintech solutions from vendors, their exposure to threats grows. The guidance explicitly states that boards of directors and senior officers must possess sufficient cybersecurity knowledge to oversee and challenge management&#39;s third-party risk strategies. DFS Acting Superintendent Kaitlin Asrow stressed that regulated entities cannot outsource their responsibility for protecting consumer data and ensuring operational security.</p><div class="flex items-center text-xs text-gray-500"><span>Oct 23, 2025</span><span class="mx-2">•</span><span>5 min read</span></div></a></article><article class="border border-gray-800 rounded-lg p-4 hover:border-cyan-500/50 transition-colors"><a href="/articles/palo-alto-networks-uncovers-smishing-and-gift-card-fraud-campaigns/" class="block"><h3 class="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300 transition-colors font-semibold mb-2">Unit 42 Exposes &#39;Smishing Deluge&#39; from China and &#39;Jingle Thief&#39; Gift Card Fraud</h3><p class="text-gray-400 text-sm mb-2">Researchers at Palo Alto Networks&#39; Unit 42 have detailed two distinct and significant cybercrime operations. The first, a massive smishing campaign dubbed &#39;The Smishing Deluge,&#39; is attributed to a China-based threat actor and is flooding mobile users globally with malicious SMS messages. The second campaign, named &#39;Jingle Thief,&#39; is a sophisticated cloud-based operation focused on automating the theft and monetization of gift cards. These findings, highlighted in Unit 42&#39;s October Threat Bulletin, showcase the diverse tactics of modern criminals, from large-scale social engineering to highly targeted financial fraud.</p><div class="flex items-center text-xs text-gray-500"><span>Oct 23, 2025</span><span class="mx-2">•</span><span>5 min read</span></div></a></article><article class="border border-gray-800 rounded-lg p-4 hover:border-cyan-500/50 transition-colors"><a href="/articles/september-healthcare-breaches-decline-but-data-incomplete-due-to-shutdown/" class="block"><h3 class="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300 transition-colors font-semibold mb-2">Healthcare Breaches Seem to Drop, But Government Shutdown Hides True Numbers</h3><p class="text-gray-400 text-sm mb-2">Official data for September 2025 shows only 26 major healthcare data breaches, the lowest monthly total since 2018. However, The HIPAA Journal cautions that this apparent decline is misleading. A US government shutdown has largely halted the HHS&#39;s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) from processing and updating its public breach portal. The 26 reported breaches affected over 1.29 million individuals, with hacking incidents accounting for 98.8% of the exposed records. Experts believe the true number of breaches for September is significantly higher and will be reflected in a surge of reports once the OCR resumes normal operations.</p><div class="flex items-center text-xs text-gray-500"><span>Oct 23, 2025</span><span class="mx-2">•</span><span>5 min read</span></div></a></article><article class="border border-gray-800 rounded-lg p-4 hover:border-cyan-500/50 transition-colors"><a href="/articles/palomar-health-medical-group-discloses-data-breach-affecting-patients/" class="block"><h3 class="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300 transition-colors font-semibold mb-2">Palomar Health Breach Exposes Highly Sensitive Patient Data, Including Biometrics</h3><p class="text-gray-400 text-sm mb-2">Palomar Health Medical Group (PHMG), a California-based healthcare provider, has announced it was the victim of a cybersecurity incident that exposed sensitive patient data. The compromised information includes not only names and personal identifiers but also highly sensitive data types such as biometric data, U.S. alien registration numbers, and financial account information. The full scope of the breach, including the number of affected patients, has not yet been disclosed.

The upgraded malware is designed for cross-platform attacks, targeting Windows, Linux, and VMware ESXi environments, signaling LockBit&#39;s intent to reclaim its dominant position in the cybercrime ecosystem.</p><div class="flex items-center text-xs text-gray-500"><span>Oct 15, 2025</span><span class="mx-2">•</span><span>5 min read</span></div></a></article><article class="border border-gray-800 rounded-lg p-4 hover:border-cyan-500/50 transition-colors"><a href="/articles/israeli-defense-firm-maya-targeted-in-hacktivist-attack/" class="block"><h3 class="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300 transition-colors font-semibold mb-2">Israeli Defense R&amp;D Firm &#39;MAYA&#39; Targeted in Pro-Resistance Hacktivist Attack</h3><p class="text-gray-400 text-sm mb-2">A hacktivist group calling itself the &#39;Cyber Support Front&#39; has claimed responsibility for a cyberattack against MAYA, an Israeli research and development firm with close ties to the country&#39;s Ministry of Defense and major defense contractors like Elbit Systems and Rafael.
