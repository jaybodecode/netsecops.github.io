The incident, which occurred between October 2024 and January 2025, involved an unauthorized third party gaining access to Conduent&#39;s network and exfiltrating files. The compromised data is highly sensitive, including names, Social Security numbers, medical information, and health insurance details. The breach has affected residents across numerous states, including Texas, Washington, and California, and has triggered a legal investigation by the law firm Edelson Lechtzin LLP into the company&#39;s data privacy practices.</p><div class="flex items-center text-xs text-gray-500"><span>Oct 30, 2025</span><span class="mx-2">•</span><span>4 min read</span></div></a></article><article class="border border-gray-800 rounded-lg p-4 hover:border-cyan-500/50 transition-colors"><a href="/articles/dentsu-subsidiary-merkle-hit-by-cyberattack-exposing-data/" class="block"><h3 class="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300 transition-colors font-semibold mb-2">Ad Giant Dentsu&#39;s Subsidiary Merkle Hit by Cyberattack, Staff and Client Data Exposed</h3><p class="text-gray-400 text-sm mb-2">Global advertising firm Dentsu has confirmed that its US-based customer experience management (CXM) subsidiary, Merkle, was the target of a cyberattack. The company detected &#39;abnormal activity&#39; on Merkle&#39;s network and proactively shut down certain systems to contain the threat. An investigation has confirmed that the incident led to the exposure of both staff and sensitive client data. Merkle, a major player in the CXM industry, handles large volumes of customer data, making it a high-value target for threat actors.

The unencrypted `.BAK` file, discovered by researchers at Neo Security, contained a treasure trove of highly sensitive internal data, including API keys, service account passwords, session tokens, and user credentials. The incident highlights the severe risks associated with cloud service misconfigurations, where tools designed for convenience can lead to catastrophic data exposure if not secured properly.

While user funds and passwords are safe, the breach creates a severe risk of identity theft and targeted phishing for affected customers.

The proposed law, which faces a critical vote on October 14, would mandate that communication platforms like Signal and WhatsApp scan all user content, including private messages and photos, for illicit material before it is encrypted. Critics, including Signal, argue this would create a backdoor for mass surveillance, fundamentally break end-to-end encryption, and create a dangerous cybersecurity precedent. The statement is a direct appeal to EU member states, particularly Germany, to vote against the measure.</p><div class="flex items-center text-xs text-gray-500"><span>Oct 7, 2025</span><span class="mx-2">•</span><span>4 min read</span></div></a></article><article class="border border-gray-800 rounded-lg p-4 hover:border-cyan-500/50 transition-colors"><a href="/articles/cisa-adds-actively-exploited-windows-clfs-privilege-escalation-flaw-to-kev/" class="block"><h3 class="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300 transition-colors font-semibold mb-2">CISA Warns of Actively Exploited Windows Privilege Escalation Flaw (CVE-2021-43226)</h3><p class="text-gray-400 text-sm mb-2">The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added CVE-2021-43226, a high-severity privilege escalation vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) Driver, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.
