Highlights include the 'CrazyHunter' ransomware crippling Taiwanese healthcare with advanced tactics, a G7 directive urging the financial sector to prepare for post-quantum cryptography, and a new supply chain attack using malicious npm packages to steal credentials from the n8n automation platform. Other major events include a massive DDoS campaign against the UK by pro-Russian hacktivists and a WEF report identifying cyber-fraud as the new top global threat.","2026-01-12",5,[10,32,51,66,81],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":26,"createdAt":30,"updatedAt":30,"readingTime":8,"isUpdate":31},"682f85d0-afe1-4fba-8ba5-dbc845ae1ca2","g7-issues-roadmap-for-post-quantum-cryptography-in-financial-sector","G7 Urges Financial Sector to Prepare for Quantum Computing Threat","G7 Releases Roadmap for Financial Sector's Transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography","informational","The G7 Cyber Expert Group (CEG), co-chaired by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Bank of England, has issued a public statement and roadmap advising the global financial sector to begin a coordinated transition to quantum-resilient technology. The guidance warns that advanced quantum computers will eventually be able to break the public-key cryptography that secures the world's financial transactions. The roadmap encourages financial institutions to start assessing their quantum risks and developing formal plans for migrating to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standards, such as those being developed by NIST, to counter 'harvest now, decrypt later' attacks.",[18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25],"G7","PQC","Post-Quantum Cryptography","Finance","Banking","NIST","U.S. Treasury","Quantum Computing",[27,28,29],"Policy and Compliance","Regulatory","Threat Intelligence","2026-01-12T15:00:00.000Z",false,{"id":33,"slug":34,"headline":35,"title":36,"severity":37,"excerpt":38,"tags":39,"categories":47,"createdAt":30,"updatedAt":30,"readingTime":8,"cves":50,"isUpdate":31},"4fe8d992-4e72-49fe-a290-8ec200caa031","malicious-npm-packages-target-n8n-automation-platform-in-supply-chain-attack","Supply Chain Attack: Malicious npm Packages Steal Credentials from n8n Automation Platform","New Supply Chain Attack Uses Malicious npm Packages to Steal Credentials from n8n Workflow Automation Platform","high","A novel supply chain attack discovered by Endor Labs is targeting users of the n8n workflow automation platform. Attackers are publishing malicious packages to the npm registry, disguised as legitimate 'community nodes' for popular services. When an unsuspecting user installs one of these nodes and enters their credentials (e.g., OAuth tokens, API keys), the malicious code exfiltrates the entire credential store from the n8n instance to an attacker-controlled server.
