The technique relies on SIM swapping, where attackers use social engineering to convince a victim's mobile carrier to transfer their phone number to a SIM card controlled by the attacker. Once they control the number, they can install WhatsApp and receive the SMS verification code to take over the account, locking the legitimate user out.
