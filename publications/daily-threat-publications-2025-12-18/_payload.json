The most urgent is Microsoft's final Patch Tuesday of the year, which addresses an actively exploited zero-day (CVE-2025-62221) in Windows, prompting a CISA directive. Concurrently, threat actors are escalating phishing campaigns against Microsoft 365 using OAuth device code abuse. Other significant events include the discovery of the 'GhostPoster' malware in Firefox add-ons, the emergence of AI-powered ransomware like 'PromptLock', and an investigation by Google into malicious code found within its search infrastructure.","2025-12-18",7,[10,34,52,68,82,94,108],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":25,"createdAt":28,"updatedAt":29,"readingTime":30,"isUpdate":31,"updateSummary":32,"updateContent":33},"a2b81f5e-4aef-45f7-ab93-6e9bffc269bf","2025-the-year-ai-redefines-cyberattacks-and-defense","2025: The Year Cybersecurity 'Crossed the AI Rubicon'","Analysis: 2025 Marks a Paradigm Shift as AI Redefines Cyberattacks and Defense","informational","According to analysis published on December 14, 2025, the year 2025 represents a fundamental and irreversible turning point for the cybersecurity industry. The widespread integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into both offensive and defensive strategies has permanently altered the threat landscape. Key trends include the rise of 'agentic AI' capable of autonomous attacks, adaptive threats that change tactics in real-time, and a surge in highly convincing, AI-generated phishing and deepfake content. While defenders are also adopting AI, the 'great acceleration' in threat complexity is forcing a complete rethink of security playbooks.",[18,19,20,21,22,23,24],"AI","artificial intelligence","generative AI","LLM","threat landscape","phishing","deepfake",[26,27],"Threat Intelligence","Other","2025-12-14T15:00:00.000Z","2025-12-18T00:00:00.000Z",4,true,"ESET's H2 2025 report reveals 'PromptLock,' the first AI-driven ransomware, and 'HybridPetya,' a destructive UEFI wiper, escalating AI-powered and destructive threats.","New intelligence from ESET's H2 2025 threat report confirms the emergence of 'PromptLock,' the first known AI-driven ransomware capable of dynamically generating malicious scripts to evade detection.
