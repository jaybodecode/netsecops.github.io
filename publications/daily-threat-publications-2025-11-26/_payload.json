A ransomware attack by the 'Inc Ransom' group has crippled the OnSolve CodeRED emergency alert system across the U.S., disrupting a vital public safety tool. In a major supply chain breach, financial tech vendor SitusAMC exposed sensitive data from top banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citi. Security researchers uncovered an unprecedented collaboration between Russian (Gamaredon) and North Korean (Lazarus) state-sponsored hacking groups using shared infrastructure. Additionally, a new, more destructive version of the 'Shai-Hulud' npm worm is causing widespread compromise, and CISA has issued warnings about spyware targeting Signal/WhatsApp users and multiple vulnerabilities in industrial control systems.","2025-11-26",6,[10,35,54,69,87,106],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":25,"createdAt":29,"updatedAt":30,"readingTime":31,"isUpdate":32,"updateSummary":33,"updateContent":34},"12bce11f-9b46-4203-b252-f20d7700d187","us-homeland-security-warns-of-rising-cyber-threats-amid-shutdown","Homeland Security Warns Gov't Shutdown and Lapsed Law Cripple U.S. Cyber Defenses","U.S. Homeland Security Committee Warns of Rising Cyber Threats Amidst Government Shutdown","high","The U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security has issued a stark warning in its latest 'Cyber Threat Snapshot,' stating that the nation's ability to defend against cyber threats is being severely hampered.
