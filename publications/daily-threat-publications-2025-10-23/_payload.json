A new report reveals ransomware groups are using automation to compress attack timelines to just 18 minutes from initial access to lateral movement. Simultaneously, another study highlights a dangerous overconfidence in supply chain security, with 94% of firms feeling prepared despite a third failing to conduct basic supplier risk assessments. This is underscored by the staggering Â£1.9 billion economic cost of the Jaguar Land Rover hack, which cascaded through 5,000 supply chain organizations. Regulators are responding, with New York's DFS issuing new guidance on third-party risk. Meanwhile, CISA has added another actively exploited vulnerability to its KEV catalog, demanding immediate action from federal agencies.","2025-10-23",7,[10,33,54,72,87,101,112],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":24,"createdAt":27,"updatedAt":28,"readingTime":29,"isUpdate":30,"updateSummary":31,"updateContent":32},"a610d974-d341-431f-b4f1-8a7c4d1f1760","uk-ncsc-warns-of-rising-supply-chain-attacks-as-significant-incidents-double","UK's NCSC Warns of Doubling 'Nationally Significant' Cyberattacks, Cites Supply Chain Risk","UK NCSC Sounds Alarm as Significant Cyber Incidents Double, Highlighting Supply Chain Vulnerabilities","high","The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has reported a sharp increase in cyberattacks, with 'nationally significant' cases more than doubling in the past year.
