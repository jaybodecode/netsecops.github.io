A new report reveals ransomware groups are using automation to compress attack timelines to just 18 minutes from initial access to lateral movement. Simultaneously, another study highlights a dangerous overconfidence in supply chain security, with 94% of firms feeling prepared despite a third failing to conduct basic supplier risk assessments. This is underscored by the staggering Â£1.9 billion economic cost of the Jaguar Land Rover hack, which cascaded through 5,000 supply chain organizations. Regulators are responding, with New York's DFS issuing new guidance on third-party risk. Meanwhile, CISA has added another actively exploited vulnerability to its KEV catalog, demanding immediate action from federal agencies.","2025-10-23",7,[10,34,53,73,90,105,116],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":24,"createdAt":28,"updatedAt":29,"readingTime":30,"isUpdate":31,"updateSummary":32,"updateContent":33},"033af511-452a-42d6-9288-29cdb3f88399","g7-experts-warn-of-ai-risks-in-financial-cybersecurity","G7 Warns Financial Sector of AI's Double-Edged Sword in Cybersecurity","G7 Cyber Expert Group Highlights AI-Driven Threats and Opportunities for Financial Sector","informational","The G7 Cyber Expert Group (CEG) has issued a statement on the dual role of Artificial Intelligence in the financial sector's cybersecurity landscape.
