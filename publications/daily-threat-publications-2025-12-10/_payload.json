Other major events include Microsoft's December Patch Tuesday addressing an actively exploited Windows zero-day, a massive NPM supply chain attack dubbed 'Shai-Hulud 2.0' that exfiltrated over 400,000 secrets, and a reported 700% surge in ransomware attacks targeting hypervisor infrastructure. The landscape is further marked by warnings of pro-Russian hacktivists targeting industrial systems and several large-scale data breaches.","2025-12-10",3,[10,29,47],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":24,"createdAt":26,"updatedAt":26,"readingTime":27,"isUpdate":28},"b011f8e8-5df5-4202-b86e-832bf2edb905","unprotected-mongodb-database-exposes-4-3-billion-professional-records","Data Disaster: 4.3 Billion Records Leaked from Unprotected MongoDB Instance","Massive Data Leak Exposes 4.3 Billion Professional Records, Including LinkedIn Data, from Open MongoDB Instance","high","One of the largest lead-generation data leaks ever recorded has been discovered by researchers from Cybernews and Bob Diachenko. An unprotected MongoDB instance, left publicly accessible without a password, exposed a staggering 4.3 billion documents, totaling 16.14 terabytes of data. The dataset contains highly detailed and structured professional and corporate intelligence, with much of the information appearing to be scraped from LinkedIn. Exposed data includes names, email addresses, phone numbers, employment history, and LinkedIn profile details. While the database was secured two days after discovery, the unknown duration of its exposure creates a significant risk of this data being used for sophisticated phishing, social engineering, and identity theft campaigns on a massive scale.",[18,19,20,21,22,23],"Data Leak","Data Breach","MongoDB","Misconfiguration","Cloud Security","LinkedIn",[19,22,25],"Policy and Compliance","2025-12-10T15:00:00.000Z",5,false,{"id":30,"slug":31,"headline":32,"title":33,"severity":34,"excerpt":35,"tags":36,"categories":44,"createdAt":26,"updatedAt":26,"readingTime":27,"isUpdate":28},"200d9f52-04db-4f30-aef0-2e2e94ea9e84","north-korean-apt-operator-trevor-greer-unmasked-by-opsec-fail","OPSEC Fail: North Korean Spy 'Trevor Greer' Exposed by Own Infostealer Infection","North Korean APT Operator 'Trevor Greer' Unmasked After Infecting Own Machine with Infostealer","medium","In a major operational security (OPSEC) failure, a North Korean state-sponsored hacker was unmasked after accidentally infecting their own machine with commodity infostealer malware like LummaC2.

According to Recorded Future's Insikt Group, GrayBravo is developing and distributing a sophisticated loader called CastleLoader to at least four separate threat clusters. These clusters then use the loader to deploy various payloads, including RedLine Stealer and NetSupport RAT. The campaigns show specialization, with one group targeting the logistics sector using phishing and social engineering, while another uses Booking.com lures to target the hospitality industry.
