A severe 11-year-old vulnerability in GNU's telnetd service (CVE-2026-24061) is now under active exploitation, granting attackers root access. The Pwn2Own Automotive event saw researchers earn over $1 million for 76 zero-days, including 37 against Tesla. Meanwhile, CISA added four new flaws to its KEV catalog, the DragonForce ransomware group targeted a U.S. bank, and Microsoft issued emergency patches to fix recent update issues. Phishing campaigns targeting LastPass users and leveraging LinkedIn for RAT distribution are also on the rise.","2026-01-24",5,[10,31,45,60,80],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":26,"createdAt":29,"updatedAt":29,"readingTime":8,"isUpdate":30},"69bd3b39-51d0-4085-bd41-0ee07a855ac9","researchers-earn-over-1-million-for-hacking-tesla-at-pwn2own-automotive-2026","Pwn2Own Automotive: Hackers Earn $1M+ Exposing 76 Zero-Days in Tesla and Other Vehicle Systems","Researchers Demonstrate 76 Zero-Day Exploits Against Tesla and Others at Pwn2Own Automotive 2026","high","At the Pwn2Own Automotive 2026 event, security researchers earned over $1 million by successfully demonstrating 76 unique zero-day exploits against a range of modern vehicle systems.
