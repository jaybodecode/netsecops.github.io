Chinese state-sponsored actors weaponized the CVSS 10.0 flaw within hours, prompting CISA to add it to the KEV catalog. The rush to mitigate the threat inadvertently caused a major global outage at Cloudflare. Concurrently, a new FinCEN report revealed ransomware payments have surpassed $2.1 billion in three years, highlighting the persistent financial drain of cybercrime. Other significant developments include the emergence of the Benzona ransomware, the Albiriox Android RAT, and a new cybercrime supergroup, 'Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters,' threatening Salesforce data.","2025-12-06",4,[10,34,56,71],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":26,"createdAt":28,"updatedAt":29,"readingTime":30,"isUpdate":31,"updateSummary":32,"updateContent":33},"338455bb-a8d3-49ba-8027-640e5abe7254","scattered-lapsus-hunters-claim-supply-chain-breach-via-gainsight-salesforce-integration","Massive Supply Chain Attack Hits 200+ Companies via Salesforce App; Hacker Group Claims Breach","Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters Claim Major Supply Chain Breach Abusing Gainsight OAuth Tokens in Salesforce","high","A hacking collective known as Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters has claimed responsibility for a large-scale supply chain attack that compromised the Salesforce data of over 200 organizations.
