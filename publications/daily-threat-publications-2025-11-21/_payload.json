The vulnerability is a local privilege escalation (LPE) bug with a CVSS score of 7.0, allowing an attacker who has already gained initial access to a system to elevate their privileges to SYSTEM level. Such flaws are critical components in post-exploitation attack chains, enabling threat actors to take full control of a compromised machine. The update also fixes 16 remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities and numerous other flaws across the Microsoft product suite.
