A massive data breach at 700Credit exposed 5.6 million consumer records, while critical vulnerabilities were disclosed in WHILL power wheelchairs and popular headphone brands, posing both physical and digital risks. Additionally, the RondoDox botnet is actively exploiting a CVSS 10.0 flaw in web frameworks.","2026-01-05",3,[10,32,49],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":24,"createdAt":26,"updatedAt":27,"readingTime":28,"isUpdate":29,"updateSummary":30,"updateContent":31},"9b5b79ec-720d-4e0a-8eae-1a5466cae5dc","ransomware-expands-to-new-regions-and-industries-report-finds","Ransomware Goes Global, Targeting New Regions and Industries with Weaker Defenses","CyberCube Report Finds Ransomware Expanding to New Territories, LockBit Group Remains Highly Active","informational","Ransomware is becoming a more globalized and unpredictable threat, according to the H2 2025 Global Threat Briefing from cyber analytics firm CyberCube. The report warns that ransomware groups are actively expanding into new geographic regions and industry sectors that have historically seen fewer attacks, often targeting those with less mature cyber defenses. The highly active LockBit ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group is a key driver of this trend. The findings suggest that traditional risk models based on geography or industry are becoming less reliable predictors of attack likelihood.",[18,19,20,21,22,23],"Ransomware Trends","CyberCube","LockBit","RaaS","Global Threat","Threat Intelligence",[23,25],"Ransomware","2025-12-12T15:00:00.000Z","2026-01-05T00:00:00.000Z",5,true,"Ransomware groups are adopting new tactics like DDoS bundling and insider recruitment due to declining profits, making attacks more complex and disruptive.","Recent analysis indicates that despite a surge in attack volume, ransomware profits are declining, forcing groups to innovate. Key new tactics include bundling DDoS attacks to increase victim coercion, aggressively recruiting corporate insiders for initial access, and a growing number of new ransomware groups emerging from outside traditional Russian strongholds. These shifts introduce 'triple extortion' and new initial access vectors, making defense more challenging and increasing overall attack severity.",{"id":33,"slug":34,"headline":35,"title":36,"severity":37,"excerpt":38,"tags":39,"categories":45,"createdAt":46,"updatedAt":46,"readingTime":47,"isUpdate":48},"1e87405d-be3c-4f08-a2c4-cbb1e065cee4","sedgwick-subsidiary-hit-by-tridentlocker-ransomware","TridentLocker Ransomware Hits Sedgwick's Federal Contracting Arm","Sedgwick Confirms Ransomware Attack on Government Solutions Subsidiary by TridentLocker","high","Claims administration giant Sedgwick confirmed on January 4, 2026, that its government-focused subsidiary, Sedgwick Government Solutions (SGS), was breached by the emerging TridentLocker ransomware group.
