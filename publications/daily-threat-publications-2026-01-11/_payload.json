Meanwhile, ransomware groups continue their assault on major corporations, with the Qilin group targeting French infrastructure firm Bouygues and the Everest group claiming a massive 900 GB data theft from Nissan. Nation-state activity also remains high, as Iran-linked MuddyWater deploys a new 'RustyWater' RAT in the Middle East, and Chinese APT 'Salt Typhoon' is linked to a hack of U.S. Congressional staff emails. Other significant events include a healthcare data breach in New Zealand, a novel 'quishing' scam in France, and a critical vulnerability disclosed in the Mailpit developer tool.","2026-01-11",9,[10,32,49,66,81,101,114,127,144],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":25,"createdAt":29,"updatedAt":29,"readingTime":30,"isUpdate":31},"62028b58-b449-464e-9b57-35d8d7aacac2","iran-linked-muddywater-apt-deploys-rustywater-rat-in-middle-east","Iran's MuddyWater APT Unveils 'RustyWater' RAT in Middle East Espionage","Iran-Linked MuddyWater APT Targets Middle East with New 'RustyWater' Rust-Based RAT","high","The Iranian state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) group MuddyWater, also known as Mango Sandstorm and TA450, has been observed deploying a new, custom-built Remote Access Trojan (RAT) named 'RustyWater'.
