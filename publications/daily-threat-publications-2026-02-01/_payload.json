Dominating the headlines are two actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Ivanti's EPMM, prompting an emergency CISA directive. Simultaneously, a sophisticated wiper malware attack, potentially linked to Russian state-actors like Sandworm, targeted over 30 energy facilities in Poland, aiming to disrupt critical infrastructure. Other major events include an FBI takedown of the RAMP ransomware forum, a supply chain attack compromising eScan antivirus, and an advanced vishing campaign mimicking ShinyHunters to breach SaaS platforms. These incidents highlight escalating threats against enterprise software, critical infrastructure, and the software supply chain.","2026-02-01",9,[10,33,53,69,85,104,119,132,144],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":24,"createdAt":27,"updatedAt":28,"readingTime":29,"isUpdate":30,"updateSummary":31,"updateContent":32},"a7056a81-a403-4bff-8add-37560e748f40","cognizant-faces-class-action-lawsuits-over-trizetto-data-breach","Cognizant Sued in Class-Action Lawsuits After TriZetto Data Breach","Cognizant and Subsidiary TriZetto Face Multiple Class-Action Lawsuits Over Healthcare Data Breach","medium","IT services giant Cognizant Technology Solutions is facing multiple class-action lawsuits in the U.S. following a significant data breach at its healthcare subsidiary, TriZetto Provider Solutions (TPS).
