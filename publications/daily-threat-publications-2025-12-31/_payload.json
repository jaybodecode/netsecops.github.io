Key incidents include 'MongoBleed,' a critical memory disclosure flaw in MongoDB, and a remote-hijacking vulnerability in WHILL electric wheelchairs. Supply chain attacks resulted in an $8.5 million theft from Trust Wallet users and the exposure of 30,000 Korean Air employee records. Additionally, a new malicious AI tool, 'DIG AI,' has emerged on the dark web, designed to automate cybercrime, and former cybersecurity professionals have pleaded guilty to conducting ransomware attacks, highlighting a severe insider threat.","2025-12-31",6,[10,34,55,76,93,112],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":25,"createdAt":28,"updatedAt":29,"readingTime":30,"isUpdate":31,"updateSummary":32,"updateContent":33},"a2b81f5e-4aef-45f7-ab93-6e9bffc269bf","2025-the-year-ai-redefines-cyberattacks-and-defense","2025: The Year Cybersecurity 'Crossed the AI Rubicon'","Analysis: 2025 Marks a Paradigm Shift as AI Redefines Cyberattacks and Defense","informational","According to analysis published on December 14, 2025, the year 2025 represents a fundamental and irreversible turning point for the cybersecurity industry. The widespread integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into both offensive and defensive strategies has permanently altered the threat landscape. Key trends include the rise of 'agentic AI' capable of autonomous attacks, adaptive threats that change tactics in real-time, and a surge in highly convincing, AI-generated phishing and deepfake content. While defenders are also adopting AI, the 'great acceleration' in threat complexity is forcing a complete rethink of security playbooks.",[18,19,20,21,22,23,24],"AI","artificial intelligence","generative AI","LLM","threat landscape","phishing","deepfake",[26,27],"Threat Intelligence","Other","2025-12-14T15:00:00.000Z","2025-12-31T00:00:00.000Z",4,true,"Dark web LLM 'DIG AI' emerges, enabling less-skilled actors to generate malicious code, phishing kits, and ransomware, escalating AI-powered cybercrime.","A new fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) named 'DIG AI' has been discovered for sale on the dark web.
