Meanwhile, CISA issued urgent warnings about actively exploited vulnerabilities in SmarterMail and VMware ESXi, both being used in ransomware attacks. Major data breaches also came to light, with an unsecured server exposing 8.7 billion records on Chinese citizens and social engineering attacks hitting investment platform Betterment and newsletter service Substack, affecting millions of users. In policy news, CISA mandated the removal of all unsupported edge devices from federal networks to combat nation-state threats.","2026-02-06",8,[10,32,49,67,83,101,116,128],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":24,"createdAt":27,"updatedAt":27,"readingTime":28,"cves":29,"cvssScore":30,"isUpdate":31},"09839cb6-cf6c-46e2-9600-ef316190b755","cisa-warns-of-actively-exploited-smartermail-rce-flaw-in-ransomware-attacks","CISA: Critical SmarterMail RCE Flaw Actively Exploited in Ransomware Attacks","CISA Adds Critical SmarterMail RCE Vulnerability (CVE-2026-24423) to KEV Catalog Amid Ransomware Exploitation","critical","The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in SmarterTools' SmarterMail, CVE-2026-24423, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.
