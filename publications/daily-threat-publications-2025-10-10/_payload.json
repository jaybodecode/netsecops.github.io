Concurrently, SonicWall admitted a breach impacted all cloud backup customers, exposing firewall configurations. Other major incidents include the 'CamoLeak' flaw in GitHub Copilot allowing code exfiltration, a supply chain breach at crypto platform Shuffle.com, and the emergence of new ransomware and APT groups.","2025-10-10",9,[10,38,57,72,86,104,120,136,147],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":25,"createdAt":29,"updatedAt":30,"readingTime":31,"cves":32,"cvssScore":34,"isUpdate":35,"updateSummary":36,"updateContent":37},"dcf8686b-2588-4cd6-b5f1-69a55ee6db88","clop-ransomware-exploits-oracle-e-business-suite-zero-day-cve-2025-61882","Cl0p Gang Exploits Oracle EBS Zero-Day in Massive Data Theft Spree","Cl0p Ransomware Linked to Widespread Data Theft via Critical Oracle E-Business Suite Zero-Day (CVE-2025-61882)","critical","The Cl0p ransomware syndicate, also known as Graceful Spider, is actively exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2025-61882, in Oracle's E-Business Suite (EBS).
