A Cl0p-affiliated group has been exploiting an Oracle E-Business Suite zero-day (CVE-2025-61882) for months, leading to an FBI warning. Concurrently, SonicWall admitted a breach impacted all cloud backup customers, exposing firewall configurations. Other major incidents include the 'CamoLeak' flaw in GitHub Copilot allowing code exfiltration, a supply chain breach at crypto platform Shuffle.com, and the emergence of new ransomware and APT groups.","2025-10-10",8,[10,31,47,62,80,96,112,123],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":24,"createdAt":28,"readingTime":29,"isUpdate":30},"716fe449-ba81-4707-a952-64cd853f90a3","camoleak-flaw-in-github-copilot-allowed-silent-code-exfiltration","GitHub Patches 'CamoLeak' Flaw in Copilot That Allowed Silent Code and Secret Exfiltration","'CamoLeak' Vulnerability in GitHub Copilot Chat Enabled Covert Data Theft via Prompt Injection","high","A critical vulnerability, dubbed 'CamoLeak,' has been discovered and patched in **[GitHub Copilot Chat](https://github.com/features/copilot)**. The flaw, rated 9.6 CVSS by researcher Omer Mayraz of Legit Security, allowed attackers to silently steal private source code, API keys, and other secrets from developers' repositories. The attack involved a novel prompt injection technique where malicious instructions were hidden in a pull request's markdown. When a developer used Copilot to review the PR, the AI would execute the hidden commands. The stolen data was then exfiltrated character-by-character using a clever trick involving **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**'s own image proxy service, Camo, bypassing standard security controls.
