CISA has added a SmarterMail RCE vulnerability (CVE-2026-24423) to its KEV catalog due to active exploitation in ransomware attacks. A massive year-long cyber-espionage campaign by an Asian APT group, TGR-STA-1030, has compromised at least 70 government and critical infrastructure organizations across 37 nations. Additionally, a new self-propagating worm, 'Shai-Hulud,' is automating software supply chain attacks by stealing developer credentials to infect npm packages. Other major developments include CISA's new directive to remove unsupported edge devices from federal networks and the discovery of new malware strains like Odyssey Stealer, Milkyway Ransomware, and the covert Pulsar RAT.","2026-02-07",7,[10,35,55,70,85,101,114],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":24,"createdAt":27,"updatedAt":28,"readingTime":29,"cves":30,"cvssScore":31,"isUpdate":32,"updateSummary":33,"updateContent":34},"09839cb6-cf6c-46e2-9600-ef316190b755","cisa-warns-of-actively-exploited-smartermail-rce-flaw-in-ransomware-attacks","CISA: Critical SmarterMail RCE Flaw Actively Exploited in Ransomware Attacks","CISA Adds Critical SmarterMail RCE Vulnerability (CVE-2026-24423) to KEV Catalog Amid Ransomware Exploitation","critical","The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in SmarterTools' SmarterMail, CVE-2026-24423, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.
