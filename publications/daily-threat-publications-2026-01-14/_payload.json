The U.S. CISA has added two actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities to its KEV catalog: a Windows information disclosure flaw (CVE-2026-20805) and a Gogs RCE flaw (CVE-2025-8110), mandating urgent action from federal agencies. In Europe, a suspected ransomware attack crippled Belgium's AZ Monica hospital, forcing the transfer of critical patients, while Spanish energy giant Endesa confirmed a massive data breach with a threat actor claiming to hold data on 20 million people. These incidents are compounded by new threat intelligence on evolving tactics from Russian GRU hackers and a strategic shift in the ransomware ecosystem towards encryptionless extortion.","2026-01-14",9,[10,32,56,72,89,112,127,141,155],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":24,"createdAt":26,"updatedAt":27,"readingTime":28,"isUpdate":29,"updateSummary":30,"updateContent":31},"5fd8ba6e-9521-49c1-b6d0-4ce743deda49","ransomware-tactics-evolve-amid-declining-profits-2026","Ransomware Evolves: Groups Recruit Insiders, Add DDoS as Profits Fall","Ransomware Trends for 2026: Declining Profits Force Tactical Shifts to Insider Recruitment and DDoS Attacks","informational","The ransomware landscape is undergoing a significant evolution heading into 2026. Despite a 47% surge in publicly reported attacks in 2025, analysis from Recorded Future shows that overall profits for threat actors have declined. This financial pressure is forcing a tactical shift. Key trends to watch for include the bundling of DDoS services with ransomware to increase victim coercion, a more aggressive focus on recruiting corporate insiders to gain initial access, and a notable globalization of new ransomware groups emerging outside of the traditional Russian sphere of influence.",[18,19,20,21,22,23],"Ransomware","Threat Intelligence","DDoS","Insider Threat","RaaS","Cybercrime",[19,18,25],"Threat Actor","2026-01-05T15:00:00.000Z","2026-01-14T00:00:00.000Z",6,true,"Ransomware groups increasingly favor 'extortion-only' attacks, abandoning encryption for silent data theft, bypassing traditional backups.","Recent analysis reveals a significant shift in ransomware tactics, with threat actors moving towards 'extortion-only' attacks that forgo data encryption entirely. Instead, they focus on silent, long-term data exfiltration, followed by threats to leak stolen information. This approach is stealthier, generates fewer alerts, and effectively bypasses backup-based recovery strategies, turning every incident into a data breach. Groups like Cl0p and ShinyHunters are pioneering this model, which accounted for a substantial portion of 2025's extortion incidents. This fundamentally changes the impact, making every attack a data breach with legal and reputational consequences, and renders backups ineffective against data leakage.",{"id":33,"slug":34,"headline":35,"title":36,"severity":37,"excerpt":38,"tags":39,"categories":48,"createdAt":51,"updatedAt":51,"readingTime":52,"cves":53,"cvssScore":54,"isUpdate":55},"0f6279e7-9758-4941-bd43-611091904ded","cisa-mandates-patch-for-actively-exploited-windows-zero-day-cve-2026-20805","CISA Mandates Patch for Exploited Windows Zero-Day Used in Attack Chains","CISA Adds Actively Exploited Windows Zero-Day (CVE-2026-20805) to KEV Catalog","high","The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has ordered federal agencies to patch a zero-day vulnerability in the Windows Desktop Window Manager (CVE-2026-20805) by February 3, 2026.
