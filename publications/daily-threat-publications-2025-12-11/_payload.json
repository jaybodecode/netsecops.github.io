Concurrently, an unpatched zero-day (CVE-2025-8110) in the Gogs Git service is under active attack, compromising hundreds of instances. New malware threats emerged with 'DroidLock' targeting Android devices and the 'AshTag' suite used by the Ashen Lepus APT against Middle Eastern governments. Other significant developments include new vulnerabilities in React, sophisticated social engineering tactics detailed by HP, and an espionage campaign, 'Operation DupeHike,' targeting Russian corporations.","2025-12-11",8,[10,39,60,74,90,105,116,133],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":26,"createdAt":30,"updatedAt":31,"readingTime":32,"cves":33,"cvssScore":35,"isUpdate":36,"updateSummary":37,"updateContent":38},"fe71cd66-b93a-41f7-80af-d41dffd07243","critical-react2shell-rce-vulnerability-in-react-and-nextjs-sparks-emergency-patching","React2Shell: Critical 10.0 CVSS RCE Flaw in React and Next.js Under Active Exploitation","Critical 'React2Shell' RCE Vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182) in React Server Components Sparks Widespread Emergency Patching","critical","A critical, unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, dubbed 'React2Shell' (CVE-2025-55182), has been disclosed in React Server Components, affecting popular frameworks like Next.js.
