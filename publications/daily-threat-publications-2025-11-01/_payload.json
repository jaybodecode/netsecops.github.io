Chinese-linked threat actors are actively leveraging an unpatched Windows vulnerability (CVE-2025-9491) to spy on European diplomats and a now-patched VMware flaw (CVE-2025-41244) for privilege escalation. Concurrently, ransomware remains a dominant threat, with the Akira group claiming a breach at Apache OpenOffice, RansomHouse hitting Japanese retailer Askul, and a massive data breach at Conduent affecting over 10.5 million individuals. Other significant developments include the discovery of new malware families 'KYBER' and 'Airstalk', a supply chain attack on the npm registry, and an ongoing campaign targeting Cisco devices in Australia.","2025-11-01",7,[10,31,51,73,85,100,113],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":24,"createdAt":25,"updatedAt":26,"readingTime":27,"isUpdate":28,"updateSummary":29,"updateContent":30},"d193cf8f-d5d4-49ba-b840-001e6cd66454","data-breaches-hit-toys-r-us-askul-verisure","Data Breaches Hit Toys 'R' Us Canada, Askul, and Verisure","Multiple Retail and Service Companies Disclose Data Breaches, Exposing Customer PII","high","A wave of data breaches has impacted several consumer-facing companies globally.
