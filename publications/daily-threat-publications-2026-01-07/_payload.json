According to research from Hudson Rock, the attacks were not sophisticated zero-day exploits but a direct result of a fundamental security failure: the absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA). The actor acquired credentials harvested by infostealer malware like RedLine and Lumma from infected employee devices. They then used these credentials to access sensitive data stored on platforms such as Progress ShareFile, Nextcloud, and OwnCloud.

The flaw, which carries the maximum possible CVSS score of 10.0, allows a remote attacker to gain complete control over a vulnerable, self-hosted n8n instance without any credentials. Discovered by Cyera Research Labs, the vulnerability stems from a Content-Type confusion issue where a file-handling function can be improperly invoked. A successful exploit could lead to the theft of sensitive credentials stored in workflows, full server compromise, and lateral movement into connected corporate systems.
