The threat landscape is further defined by major zero-day attacks, with the FIN11/Clop ransomware group targeting Oracle EBS systems at industrial giants, and the 'Mem3nt0 mori' APT exploiting a Chrome zero-day. New malware strains have also emerged, including 'Airstalk' in a suspected nation-state supply chain attack and 'Herodotus', an Android trojan that mimics human behavior. Additionally, a report highlights the destructive impact of the 'Scattered Spider' group and a massive surge in AI-powered vishing attacks.","2025-10-29",7,[10,33,55,74,88,102,120],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":26,"createdAt":28,"updatedAt":29,"readingTime":8,"isUpdate":30,"updateSummary":31,"updateContent":32},"23c3ba71-cc33-4132-89a7-378c36dbc468","qantas-customer-data-leaked-online-after-ransom-deadline-passes","Qantas Data Breach: 5.7M Customer Records Leaked in Salesforce Supply Chain Attack","Hacker Collective 'Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters' Leaks 5.7 Million Qantas Customer Records Following Ransom Demand","high","The personal data of 5.7 million Qantas Airways customers has been published on the dark web by a group calling itself 'Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters'. The leak, which occurred after a ransom deadline passed on October 11, 2025, is part of a broader supply chain attack that compromised a third-party Salesforce system used by one of the airline's offshore call centers. The compromised data includes names, emails, frequent flyer information, and for some, addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth. The attack vector involved social engineering, with hackers impersonating Salesforce employees to gain access.
