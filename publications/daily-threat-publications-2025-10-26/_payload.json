A severe, actively exploited remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2025-59287) in Microsoft's WSUS has prompted an emergency out-of-band patch, with CISA mandating immediate action. In a massive supply chain attack, Dublin Airport disclosed a data breach affecting 3.8 million passengers after a third-party provider, Collins Aerospace, was compromised by ransomware. Meanwhile, a DDoS attack on Russia's food safety agency crippled national supply chains, the Safepay ransomware group targeted a German video surveillance firm, and dozens of nations signed a landmark, albeit controversial, UN cybercrime treaty in Hanoi.","2025-10-26",2,[10,29],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":23,"createdAt":26,"updatedAt":26,"readingTime":27,"isUpdate":28},"f3948923-5a86-4219-8437-3ce065cc5cd7","ddos-attack-russian-food-safety-agency-disrupts-supply-chain","DDoS Attack on Russian Food Agency Cripples National Supply Chains","Massive DDoS Attack on Russia's Rosselkhoznadzor Disrupts Food Shipments Nationwide","high","Russia's federal agency for veterinary and phytosanitary surveillance, Rosselkhoznadzor, has been targeted by a large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack starting October 22, 2025. The attack crippled the agency's critical electronic certification systems, including the 'Mercury' platform, which is essential for tracking animal products. The outage caused significant delays in food shipments from major producers of meat, milk, and baby food across the nation, highlighting the vulnerability of critical national infrastructure to cyberattacks.
