Multiple threat actors are leveraging the React2Shell flaw (CVE-2025-55182) to deploy ransomware. Concurrently, a China-linked APT is exploiting a zero-day in Cisco email gateways (CVE-2025-20393), and actively exploited flaws in WatchGuard firewalls and Google Chrome are putting networks and users at severe risk. Other major incidents include critical patches for HPE OneView, significant data breaches at SoundCloud and 700Credit, and new regulatory updates from the UK.","2025-12-19",4,[10,36,53,69],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":26,"createdAt":30,"updatedAt":30,"readingTime":31,"cves":32,"cvssScore":34,"isUpdate":35},"a5bdcac9-eafd-46c7-919d-4551f2afcc11","china-linked-apt-exploits-cisco-email-gateway-zero-day","China-Linked Hackers Exploit Critical Cisco Email Gateway Zero-Day","Cisco Discloses Actively Exploited Zero-Day (CVE-2025-20393) in Email Security Appliances Linked to Chinese APT","critical","Cisco has revealed that a China-affiliated advanced persistent threat (APT) group, tracked as UAT-9686, is actively exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability in its email security products. The flaw, CVE-2025-20393, is a remote code execution vulnerability with a maximum CVSS score of 10.0, affecting Cisco Secure Email Gateway and Secure Email and Web Manager appliances. The attackers have been exploiting the flaw since late November 2025 to gain root-level access and have deployed persistence mechanisms on compromised devices.
