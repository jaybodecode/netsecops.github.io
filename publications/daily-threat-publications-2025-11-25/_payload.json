Additionally, CISA has issued directives for actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Oracle Identity Manager, Google Chrome, and Fortinet's FortiWeb. Other major threats include the Akira ransomware group targeting M&A activities, a surge in Black Friday phishing scams, and a data breach at a major banking vendor, SitusAMC.","2025-11-25",2,[10,38],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":25,"createdAt":29,"updatedAt":30,"readingTime":31,"cves":32,"isUpdate":35,"updateSummary":36,"updateContent":37},"815dbf5f-459d-4979-b189-ce8c9d974fb6","cisa-mandates-7-day-patch-for-actively-exploited-fortinet-fortiweb-zero-day-cve-2025-58034","URGENT: CISA Orders 7-Day Patch for Actively Exploited FortiWeb Zero-Day","Fortinet Discloses Critical FortiWeb Zero-Day (CVE-2025-58034) Under Active Attack; CISA Issues Emergency Directive","critical","Fortinet has disclosed a critical OS command injection zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2025-58034, in its FortiWeb Web Application Firewall (WAF) that is being actively exploited in the wild. The flaw allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system. In response to observed attacks, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog and issued an emergency directive mandating federal agencies apply patches within an accelerated seven-day window, by November 25, 2025.
