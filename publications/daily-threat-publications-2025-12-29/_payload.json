CISA has issued an urgent warning about the 'MongoBleed' (CVE-2025-14847) vulnerability in MongoDB, now under active exploitation. Supply chain attacks continue to escalate, with Korean Air suffering a breach via a subsidiary, attributed to the Clop ransomware group exploiting an Oracle zero-day. A year-end report confirms that software supply chain attacks more than doubled in 2025. Ransomware groups, including Qilin and Medusa, capitalized on the holiday period to launch a wave of attacks, while malicious Chrome extensions were found to have stolen AI chat data from nearly a million users. Finally, Microsoft and Adobe released their last patches of the year, fixing over 190 vulnerabilities, including an actively exploited Windows zero-day.","2025-12-29",7,[10,32,50,68,79,97,116],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":23,"createdAt":26,"updatedAt":27,"readingTime":28,"isUpdate":29,"updateSummary":30,"updateContent":31},"9d2f19c4-5c5e-4e40-8d57-8d21214e532f","qilin-ransomware-group-claims-b-dynamic-as-new-victim","Qilin Ransomware Gang Adds Business Services Firm B Dynamic to Leak Site","Qilin Ransomware Group Claims B Dynamic as New Victim in Ongoing Double-Extortion Campaign","high","The Qilin ransomware group, a prominent ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation, has listed business services company 'B Dynamic' as its latest victim on its dark web data leak site.
