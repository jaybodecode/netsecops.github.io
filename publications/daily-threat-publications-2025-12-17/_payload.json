A CVSS 10.0 flaw in React, dubbed 'React2Shell,' is being widely abused by both state actors and cybercriminals to deploy backdoors and miners. CISA has added a critical, actively exploited Fortinet SSO vulnerability to its KEV catalog. Meanwhile, a new Palo Alto Networks report reveals that rapid AI adoption is massively expanding the cloud attack surface, with 99% of organizations reporting attacks on their AI systems. Other major events include a cyberattack on the French Interior Ministry, a novel 'ConsentFix' phishing technique bypassing MFA to hijack Microsoft accounts, and a large-scale malware alert in New Zealand for Lumma Stealer infections.","2025-12-17",7,[10,33,54,72,89,104,122],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":24,"createdAt":27,"updatedAt":28,"readingTime":29,"isUpdate":30,"updateSummary":31,"updateContent":32},"17a99b54-ec4d-498e-a197-324c5960e2fa","access-broker-storm-0249-shifts-to-advanced-ransomware-delivery","Storm-0249 Evolves: Access Broker Now Deploys Ransomware with Advanced Stealth Tactics","Threat Actor Storm-0249 Shifts from Access Broker to Hands-On Ransomware Enabler","medium","The initial access broker (IAB) known as Storm-0249 is evolving its tactics, moving beyond simply selling network access to actively participating in malware deployment. According to ReliaQuest, the group now uses more sophisticated techniques, including DLL side-loading and fileless PowerShell execution, to facilitate ransomware attacks directly. Their methods involve social engineering victims into running malicious commands (`ClickFix`), which fetch and execute PowerShell scripts from spoofed domains. A key technique is dropping a trojanized version of a SentinelOne security agent DLL to run malware under the guise of a trusted process. This evolution signifies a dangerous trend where IABs are becoming more integrated into the ransomware deployment process, increasing their threat level.",[18,19,20,21,22,23],"Storm-0249","IAB","Ransomware","DLL Side-loading","ClickFix","PowerShell",[25,20,26],"Threat Actor","Malware","2025-12-10T15:00:00.000Z","2025-12-17T00:00:00.000Z",6,true,"Push Security launches browser tool to block 'ClickFix' copy-paste attacks, directly mitigating a key social engineering tactic.","Push Security has released a new browser-based 'malicious copy-and-paste detection' feature designed to combat 'ClickFix' social engineering attacks.

The attacker then uses this code to authenticate as the user via the legitimate and trusted Microsoft Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI).
