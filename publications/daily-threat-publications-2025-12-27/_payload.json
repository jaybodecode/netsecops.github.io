Concurrently, the CISA deadline passed for patching the 'React2Shell' flaw (CVE-2025-55182), which is already under active exploitation by state-sponsored actors. The holiday period saw targeted ransomware attacks, with the 'Gentlemen' group hitting a major Romanian energy producer and LockBit 5.0 claiming a breach of a Greek luxury hotel brand. Other significant events include the discovery of a critical RCE in the n8n automation platform, a supply chain attack on Trust Wallet leading to a $7 million theft, and a sophisticated DNS poisoning campaign by the China-linked 'Evasive Panda' APT.","2025-12-27",5,[10,33,49,66,79],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":24,"createdAt":27,"updatedAt":27,"readingTime":28,"cves":29,"cvssScore":31,"isUpdate":32},"937a792a-f0f8-47ec-abd3-b21c1774187d","critical-rce-flaw-cve-2025-68613-in-n8n-automation-platform-risks-103k-servers","Critical RCE Flaw in n8n Puts 103,000+ Workflow Automation Servers at Risk","Critical RCE Vulnerability (CVE-2025-68613) in n8n Platform Allows Full Server Compromise","critical","A critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, CVE-2025-68613, with a CVSS score of 9.9, has been disclosed in the n8n workflow automation platform.
