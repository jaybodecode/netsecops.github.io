A critical Citrix zero-day, 'CitrixBleed 2.0', led to a major data breach at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, exposing employee data. Nation-state activity remains high, with China-linked Salt Typhoon targeting European telecoms and Russia-linked COLDRIVER rapidly deploying new malware after public disclosure. A novel supply chain attack, 'GlassWorm', is targeting VS Code developers using advanced obfuscation and a blockchain-based C2. Meanwhile, new reports highlight a 34% surge in ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure and the growing challenge of AI-powered cyberattacks outpacing organizational defenses.","2025-10-21",8,[10,34,52,68,83,97,117,130],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":25,"createdAt":29,"updatedAt":29,"readingTime":30,"cves":31,"isUpdate":33},"1068c58e-cc4d-4536-9a40-967992ad278e","dhs-breach-fema-cbp-data-exposed-via-citrix-zero-day","DHS Breach: 'CitrixBleed 2.0' Zero-Day Exposes FEMA & CBP Employee Data","U.S. Department of Homeland Security Confirms Data Breach Affecting FEMA and CBP Employees via Citrix 'CitrixBleed 2.0' Zero-Day","critical","A critical zero-day vulnerability in Citrix NetScaler Gateway, dubbed 'CitrixBleed 2.0' (CVE-2025-5777), was exploited to breach the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
