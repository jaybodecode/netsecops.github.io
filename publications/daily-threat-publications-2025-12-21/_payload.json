Security teams are grappling with zero-days in Microsoft Windows, SonicWall, and WatchGuard appliances, all added to CISA's KEV catalog. A new CVSS 10.0 flaw dubbed 'React2Shell' is being used to compromise web applications globally. Major incidents also include a significant data breach at fintech vendor Marquis impacting over 400,000 bank customers, a sophisticated 'GhostPairing' account takeover attack on WhatsApp, and a ransomware strike on an Australian fertility clinic. These events highlight persistent threats from unpatched systems, supply chain weaknesses, and social engineering.","2025-12-21",6,[10,38,62,80,94,111],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":25,"createdAt":29,"updatedAt":30,"readingTime":31,"cves":32,"cvssScore":34,"isUpdate":35,"updateSummary":36,"updateContent":37},"7cab1cd3-fcfa-4f0c-b287-44edc184d138","react2shell-critical-rce-flaw-under-mass-exploitation-by-state-actors-and-botnets","React2Shell Apocalypse: CVSS 10.0 Flaw Exploited by China, North Korea, and Botnets","React2Shell: Critical RCE Vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182) Under Mass Exploitation by State Actors and Criminals","critical","A critical, unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability (CVSS 10.0) in React Server Components, dubbed 'React2Shell' and tracked as CVE-2025-55182, is under widespread attack.
