Key developments include the discovery of 'Airstalk,' a new Chinese APT malware using MDM APIs for C2 in supply chain attacks against the BPO sector. In a shocking insider threat case, cybersecurity professionals were indicted for using ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware. The Cl0p ransomware group is actively exploiting an Oracle zero-day (CVE-2025-61882), while an unpatched Windows LNK flaw (CVE-2025-9491) continues to be leveraged by APTs. Additionally, new reports highlight advanced phishing on LinkedIn, the massive financial fallout from the SK Telecom breach, and escalating ransomware attacks across Europe.","2025-11-03",7,[10,35,57,74,88,105,123],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":25,"createdAt":28,"updatedAt":29,"readingTime":30,"cves":31,"isUpdate":32,"updateSummary":33,"updateContent":34},"8d828531-2161-465d-a72c-7e61a4685b02","clop-ransomware-exploits-oracle-e-business-suite-zero-day","Cl0p Ransomware Exploits Oracle EBS Zero-Day in Active Attacks","Cl0p Ransomware Gang Actively Exploiting Oracle E-Business Suite Zero-Day (CVE-2025-61882)","critical","The notorious Cl0p ransomware gang is actively exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2025-61882, in Oracle's E-Business Suite (EBS) to gain initial access to corporate networks.
