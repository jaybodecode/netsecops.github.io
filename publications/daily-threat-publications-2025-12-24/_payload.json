Chinese state-sponsored actors are leveraging a CVSS 10.0 zero-day in Cisco email gateways, while another CVSS 10.0 flaw, React2Shell, is being used by nation-states against SaaS and FinTech firms. CISA has issued urgent patch deadlines for these, as well as for exploited flaws in WatchGuard firewalls, Fortinet devices, and the Android OS. Major data breaches were also disclosed, with Nissan confirming a supply chain attack via Red Hat affecting 21,000 customers, and the University of Sydney reporting a breach impacting 27,000 individuals due to a DevSecOps failure.","2025-12-24",3,[10,38,48],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":27,"createdAt":29,"updatedAt":30,"readingTime":31,"cves":32,"cvssScore":34,"isUpdate":35,"updateSummary":36,"updateContent":37},"b39aa585-74eb-4582-b7db-484c6bb8f937","cisa-adds-actively-exploited-fortinet-sso-vulnerability-to-kev-catalog","CISA Adds Actively Exploited Fortinet SSO Flaw to KEV Catalog, Urges Immediate Patching","CISA Warns of Active Exploitation of Critical Fortinet SSO Bypass Vulnerability (CVE-2025-59718)","critical","The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a critical Fortinet vulnerability, CVE-2025-59718, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, indicating active attacks in the wild. The flaw, rated 9.1 CVSS, allows an unauthenticated attacker to bypass FortiCloud single sign-on (SSO) authentication on multiple products, including FortiOS and FortiProxy, by sending a crafted SAML message. Security firm Arctic Wolf observed attackers exploiting the flaw within days of its disclosure to export device configurations and harvest credentials.
