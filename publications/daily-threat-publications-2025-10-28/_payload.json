Microsoft is scrambling to contain an actively exploited RCE vulnerability in WSUS (CVE-2025-59287) after a botched patch, forcing an emergency update. In the ransomware landscape, the Qilin group has surged to become the most prolific threat of 2025 with over 700 attacks, while payment rates have hit a record low. Other major incidents include a data breach at Sweden's power grid operator claimed by the Everest gang, a massive leak of 4.8 million patient records from Kenya's M-TIBA health platform, and new CISA alerts for critical flaws in industrial control systems and endpoint management software.","2025-10-28",10,[10,34,55,73,89,108,123,138,156,171],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":26,"createdAt":28,"updatedAt":29,"readingTime":30,"isUpdate":31,"updateSummary":32,"updateContent":33},"02a78710-0d01-46eb-a99b-9aed6ffd560e","ai-powered-phishing-emails-prove-4-5-times-more-effective-microsoft-report-finds","Microsoft Report: AI-Generated Phishing Now 4.5x More Effective, Bypassing Traditional Defenses","AI-Powered Phishing Emails Achieve 54% Click-Through Rate, Microsoft's 2025 Digital Defense Report Reveals","high","According to the Microsoft 2025 Digital Defense Report, the effectiveness of phishing attacks has surged with the adoption of artificial intelligence.
