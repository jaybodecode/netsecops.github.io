A threat actor alliance named 'Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters' claims to have stolen data from over 40 Salesforce customers via social engineering, though Salesforce itself was not breached and refuses to pay the ransom. Concurrently, the Cl0p ransomware group is actively exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-61882) in Oracle's E-Business Suite. Other major events include a significant data breach at a Red Hat consulting GitLab instance exposing sensitive client data, a ransomware attack by the Qilin group on Japanese beverage giant Asahi, and CISA adding a Zimbra XSS flaw to its KEV catalog.","2025-10-08",9,[10,37,57,75,90,102,116,131,144],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":25,"createdAt":28,"updatedAt":29,"readingTime":30,"cves":31,"cvssScore":33,"isUpdate":34,"updateSummary":35,"updateContent":36},"876cd663-5651-48fe-bbc5-f088d248a886","clop-exploits-critical-oracle-e-business-suite-zero-day-cve-2025-61882","Clop Exploits Critical Oracle Zero-Day; CISA Issues Emergency Patch Directive","Clop Ransomware Group Actively Exploiting Critical Oracle E-Business Suite Zero-Day (CVE-2025-61882)","critical","Multiple international cybersecurity agencies, including CISA, the UK's NCSC, and Singapore's CSA, have issued urgent warnings about a critical zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2025-61882, in Oracle E-Business Suite.
