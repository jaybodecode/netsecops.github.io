Headlining the news are two maximum-severity (CVSS 10.0) remote code execution flaws in the n8n workflow automation platform, one unauthenticated and one authenticated, prompting urgent patching. Concurrently, a zero-day RCE is being actively exploited in end-of-life D-Link routers, with no patch forthcoming. CISA has added exploited flaws in HPE OneView and legacy PowerPoint to its KEV catalog. Major incidents include a data breach claim against broadband provider Brightspeed by the Crimson Collective, a ransomware attack on claims giant Sedgwick by TridentLocker, and a large-scale SEO poisoning campaign by the Black Cat group. Additionally, reports highlight novel phishing tactics abusing Microsoft 365 and Google Cloud services, and malicious Chrome extensions stealing AI chat data from nearly a million users.","2026-01-08",5,[10,32,55,72,85],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":25,"createdAt":26,"updatedAt":27,"readingTime":28,"isUpdate":29,"updateSummary":30,"updateContent":31},"7d8593e3-fc10-4ab6-814f-b92655985fa5","claims-giant-sedgwick-hit-by-tridentlocker-ransomware-group","TridentLocker Ransomware Strikes Claims Giant Sedgwick in Breach-then-Encrypt Attack","Sedgwick Becomes Latest Victim of TridentLocker Ransomware, Highlighting Modern Data Exfiltration and Extortion Tactics","high","Global claims management leader Sedgwick has reportedly been targeted by the TridentLocker ransomware group. The attack follows the increasingly common 'breach-then-encrypt' model, where threat actors first exfiltrate sensitive data before deploying ransomware to encrypt systems. TridentLocker claims to have stolen data from systems supporting Sedgwick's government services operations, a move designed to maximize pressure for a ransom payment. This incident underscores the evolution of ransomware from a simple availability attack to a complex data breach and extortion scheme.
