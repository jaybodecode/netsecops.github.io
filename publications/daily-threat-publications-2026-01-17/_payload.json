Palo Alto Networks released urgent patches for a high-severity denial-of-service vulnerability (CVE-2026-0227) affecting its firewalls, allowing attackers to remotely disable network protection. In a major blow to cybercrime infrastructure, Microsoft and global law enforcement agencies successfully dismantled the RedVDS 'Cybercrime-as-a-Service' platform, which was responsible for over $40 million in fraud. Concurrently, the NSA published new foundational guidelines for Zero Trust adoption, aiming to bolster national cybersecurity posture. Other key developments include strategic product launches and acquisitions from Infoblox, SpyCloud, and Acronis, all focused on enhancing threat visibility and response capabilities.","2026-01-17",11,[10,32,51,68,81,96,112,128,141,156,170],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":26,"createdAt":29,"updatedAt":29,"readingTime":30,"isUpdate":31},"d71a669c-be15-4325-8a3d-fe3961d31443","microsoft-and-law-enforcement-dismantle-redvds-cybercrime-as-a-service-platform","RedVDS Takedown: Microsoft and Law Enforcement Disrupt $40M Cybercrime-as-a-Service Operation","Microsoft and Global Law Enforcement Dismantle RedVDS Cybercrime-as-a-Service Platform","high","In a major international operation, Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit, alongside law enforcement from the U.S., U.K., and Germany, has disrupted the RedVDS cybercrime-as-a-service (CaaS) platform.
