Concurrently, new reports confirm that 2025 was a record-breaking year for ransomware, with a 58% surge in attacks. Other major incidents include the Everest ransomware group's claimed breach of Nissan, active exploitation of a critical WordPress plugin flaw, and the discovery of sophisticated malware frameworks like VoidLink targeting cloud environments and GlassWorm targeting macOS developers.","2026-01-16",6,[10,31,51,65,82,100],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":26,"createdAt":28,"updatedAt":28,"readingTime":29,"isUpdate":30},"7e66af22-ead2-4097-867b-df7f322253ce","aws-codebuild-codebreach-supply-chain-vulnerability","AWS Patches 'CodeBreach' Flaw, Averting Massive GitHub Supply Chain Attack","AWS Fixes Critical \"CodeBreach\" Flaw in CodeBuild That Exposed GitHub Repositories to Widespread Supply Chain Attacks","critical","Amazon Web Services (AWS) has remediated a critical vulnerability in its AWS CodeBuild service, dubbed 'CodeBreach' by Wiz researchers. The flaw, which stemmed from a misconfigured webhook filter, could have allowed unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious code into the build processes of major open-source projects, including the AWS JavaScript SDK. An exploit could have granted attackers administrative control over key GitHub repositories, creating a catastrophic supply chain risk for the millions of applications and cloud environments that depend on these libraries. The vulnerability was discovered following a separate, failed attack attempt, highlighting the real-world threat.
