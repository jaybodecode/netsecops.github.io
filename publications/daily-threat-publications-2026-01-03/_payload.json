The Iran-linked Handala group has escalated its psychological warfare campaign by doxing Israeli SIGINT officers, primarily through Telegram account compromises. Meanwhile, critical, actively exploited vulnerabilities in Fortinet firewalls (CVE-2020-12812) and Next.js (CVE-2025-55182) are being leveraged by threat actors for 2FA bypass and botnet creation, respectively. Other major incidents include a massive data breach claim against Tokyo FM radio, the rise of the VVS Stealer malware, and a widespread phishing campaign abusing Google Tasks.","2026-01-03",8,[10,32,46,60,78,94,110,125],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":26,"createdAt":29,"updatedAt":29,"readingTime":30,"isUpdate":31},"b5870ec1-5081-4e70-94e3-35ec02aeb657","handala-group-exposes-israeli-sigint-agents-in-telegram-compromise","Handala Group Doxes Israeli Intel Agents in Psyops Campaign","Iran-Linked Handala Group Leaks Identities of Israeli SIGINT Officers in Targeted Information Warfare Campaign","high","The Iran-linked hacktivist group Handala has intensified its information warfare against Israel by publicly exposing the identities of 15 alleged Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) officers on January 3, 2026. This act of doxing is the latest in a series of campaigns designed to inflict psychological and reputational damage on Israeli intelligence and government officials. Investigations by cybersecurity firm KELA suggest Handala's primary attack vector is not sophisticated device hacking but rather the compromise of messaging applications like Telegram, likely through social engineering or session hijacking.
