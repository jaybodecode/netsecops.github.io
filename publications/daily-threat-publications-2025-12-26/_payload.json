A public exploit for 'MongoBleed' (CVE-2025-14847), a severe memory leak flaw in MongoDB, has been released and is under active attack. Multiple Chinese APT groups, including 'Evasive Panda', 'Silver Fox', and 'HoneyMyte', have launched sophisticated espionage campaigns using advanced techniques like DNS poisoning and kernel-mode rootkits. Concurrently, a ransomware attack by the 'Gentlemen' group struck a major Romanian energy producer, and CISA issued alerts for several critical vulnerabilities, underscoring a period of heightened threat activity.","2025-12-26",8,[10,32,48,70,85,103,116,131],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":25,"createdAt":29,"updatedAt":29,"readingTime":30,"isUpdate":31},"92ec15a1-4917-4060-8e89-571ac023e36b","chinese-apt-evasive-panda-deploys-mgbot-backdoor-via-dns-poisoning","Evasive Panda APT Hijacks DNS to Deploy MgBot Backdoor in Multi-Country Espionage Campaign","Chinese APT 'Evasive Panda' Uses DNS Poisoning and Adversary-in-the-Middle Attacks to Deliver MgBot Backdoor","high","A sophisticated, long-running cyber-espionage campaign by the China-linked threat actor 'Evasive Panda' (also known as Bronze Highland) has been detailed.

Instead of traditional phishing, the attackers used adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks, specifically DNS poisoning, to hijack legitimate software update channels.
