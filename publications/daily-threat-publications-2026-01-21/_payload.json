The EU has proposed a revised Cybersecurity Act to ban high-risk tech suppliers from critical sectors, a move largely targeting Chinese firms. In threat intelligence, researchers have detailed 'VoidLink,' a sophisticated Linux malware framework believed to be one of the first advanced threats predominantly built with AI assistance. Meanwhile, the RansomHub group claims a major breach against Apple supplier Luxshare, threatening to leak sensitive R&D data, and Oracle has released a critical patch for a CVSS 10.0 vulnerability in WebLogic Server.","2026-01-21",6,[10,33,52,68,80,98],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":26,"createdAt":30,"updatedAt":30,"readingTime":31,"isUpdate":32},"73359bb7-1eee-4c68-90cc-cdc11e99ce8c","eu-proposes-revised-cybersecurity-act-to-ban-high-risk-tech-suppliers","EU Moves to Ban High-Risk Tech Suppliers from 18 Critical Sectors","European Commission Proposes Revised Cybersecurity Act to Phase Out High-Risk ICT Suppliers from Critical Infrastructure","high","On January 20, 2026, the European Commission introduced a revised EU Cybersecurity Act (CSA 2) aimed at bolstering the bloc's supply chain security. The proposal establishes a framework to identify and exclude high-risk technology suppliers from 18 critical sectors, including energy and telecommunications. This move is widely interpreted as a measure to reduce dependency on Chinese technology providers. The act mandates the derisking of mobile networks by requiring operators to replace equipment from designated high-risk vendors within three years. It also aims to streamline the European Cybersecurity Certification Framework (ECCF) to make compliance faster and more accessible, particularly for SMEs, and strengthens the mandate of the EU's cybersecurity agency, ENISA.",[18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25],"EU Cybersecurity Act","CSA 2","Supply Chain Security","High-Risk Vendors","5G Security","ENISA","Regulation","Compliance",[27,28,29],"Policy and Compliance","Regulatory","Supply Chain Attack","2026-01-21T15:00:00.000Z",5,false,{"id":34,"slug":35,"headline":36,"title":37,"severity":38,"excerpt":39,"tags":40,"categories":49,"createdAt":30,"updatedAt":30,"readingTime":31,"cves":50,"cvssScore":51,"isUpdate":32},"13ad4e28-db23-4995-842c-da2abf41b9cd","oracle-january-2026-critical-patch-update-fixes-337-flaws-including-cvss-10-bug","Oracle Issues Critical Patch for CVSS 10.0 Auth Bypass in WebLogic Server","Oracle's January 2026 Critical Patch Update Addresses 337 Vulnerabilities, Including a Perfect 10.0 Flaw","critical","Oracle has released its January 2026 Critical Patch Update (CPU), a massive security release containing 337 fixes for vulnerabilities across its product portfolio. The most severe flaw addressed is CVE-2026-21962, a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in the Oracle WebLogic Server Proxy Plug-in with a CVSS score of 10.0. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely by a low-privileged attacker without user interaction, potentially allowing complete takeover of the affected component. The flaw impacts WebLogic Server Proxy Plug-in versions 12.2.1.4.0, 14.1.1.0.0, and 14.1.2.0.0.
