The EU has proposed a revised Cybersecurity Act to ban high-risk tech suppliers from critical sectors, a move largely targeting Chinese firms. In threat intelligence, researchers have detailed 'VoidLink,' a sophisticated Linux malware framework believed to be one of the first advanced threats predominantly built with AI assistance. Meanwhile, the RansomHub group claims a major breach against Apple supplier Luxshare, threatening to leak sensitive R&D data, and Oracle has released a critical patch for a CVSS 10.0 vulnerability in WebLogic Server.","2026-01-21",4,[10,32,48,66],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":26,"createdAt":27,"updatedAt":27,"readingTime":28,"cves":29,"cvssScore":30,"isUpdate":31},"13ad4e28-db23-4995-842c-da2abf41b9cd","oracle-january-2026-critical-patch-update-fixes-337-flaws-including-cvss-10-bug","Oracle Issues Critical Patch for CVSS 10.0 Auth Bypass in WebLogic Server","Oracle's January 2026 Critical Patch Update Addresses 337 Vulnerabilities, Including a Perfect 10.0 Flaw","critical","Oracle has released its January 2026 Critical Patch Update (CPU), a massive security release containing 337 fixes for vulnerabilities across its product portfolio. The most severe flaw addressed is CVE-2026-21962, a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in the Oracle WebLogic Server Proxy Plug-in with a CVSS score of 10.0. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely by a low-privileged attacker without user interaction, potentially allowing complete takeover of the affected component. The flaw impacts WebLogic Server Proxy Plug-in versions 12.2.1.4.0, 14.1.1.0.0, and 14.1.2.0.0.

The compromised data reportedly includes a vast amount of personal information on customers and employees, as well as internal corporate documents. This incident, if confirmed, would be the latest in a series of data security issues for the fast-food giant's Indian operations, which suffered previous breaches.

The study highlights that as drone technology becomes more advanced, accessible, and affordable, its potential for use in cyber warfare is growing significantly. Researchers found that drones can be used as platforms to launch sophisticated cyberattacks against targets like data centers and telecommunications networks, exploiting gaps in physical and cybersecurity defenses. The report stresses a significant disconnect between the current level of threat awareness among infrastructure operators and the real-world capabilities of modern drones, urging industries to integrate drone-related risks into their security and resilience programs.",[56,57,58,59,60,61,62],"Drone","Cyberattack","Critical Infrastructure","Cisco","Physical Security","Wireless Security","WIDS",[57,64,65],"Threat Intelligence","Industrial Control Systems",{"id":67,"slug":68,"headline":69,"title":70,"severity":53,"excerpt":71,"tags":72,"categories":81,"createdAt":27,"updatedAt":27,"readingTime":84,"isUpdate":31},"c8ae8a15-e846-440f-b285-24af03a91af2","nydfs-implements-stricter-cybersecurity-rules-for-financial-firms","NYDFS Enforces Stricter Cybersecurity Rules for Financial Firms","New York's NYDFS Implements Final Amendments to Part 500, Mandating Stricter Controls for Financial Institutions","The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has now fully implemented the final amendments to its landmark Part 500 Cybersecurity Regulation. These changes impose significantly more prescriptive and stringent requirements on regulated financial and insurance entities. As of May 2025, firms are mandated to have automated vulnerability scanning, enhanced access controls, and robust logging and monitoring capabilities, including endpoint detection and response (EDR). The amendments also place a strong emphasis on proactive governance of third-party service providers, including cloud and AI vendors.
