Major themes include the active exploitation of a zero-day in Oracle E-Business Suite by the Cl0p ransomware group and the patching of a 13-year-old RCE flaw in Redis. Supply chain attacks remain a dominant threat, with malicious npm and Node.js packages targeting developers, and a Discord breach originating from a third-party vendor. SonicWall disclosed two major incidents: active exploitation of its VPNs by Akira ransomware and a full-scale breach of its Cloud Backup service affecting all customers. Additionally, new malware strains like 'Chaosbot' and the AI-powered 'MalTerminal' demonstrate evolving attacker TTPs.","2025-10-11",7,[10,30,45,60,78,90,102],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":23,"createdAt":27,"readingTime":28,"isUpdate":29},"50d68aaf-5022-4631-ba79-3a54daff8605","discord-confirms-data-breach-via-third-party-support-vendor","Discord Breach Exposes 5.5M Users via Third-Party Vendor Compromise","Discord Confirms Data Breach Through Compromised Third-Party Support Vendor, Zendesk","high","Discord has officially confirmed a data breach that originated from a compromised third-party customer support vendor, Zendesk. The incident exposed the data of users who had interacted with Discord's support channels. Hackers claim to have exfiltrated information from 5.5 million users, including usernames, email addresses, IP addresses, and the contents of support tickets. Discord has assured its community that sensitive data such as passwords and authentication tokens were not compromised. In response, Discord has revoked the vendor's system access and is in the process of notifying all affected individuals, highlighting the persistent risks associated with third-party supply chain security.",[18,19,20,21,22],"third-party risk","supply chain","customer support","data exfiltration","phishing",[24,25,26],"Data Breach","Supply Chain Attack","Cloud Security","2025-10-11T15:00:00.000Z",5,false,{"id":31,"slug":32,"headline":33,"title":34,"severity":15,"excerpt":35,"tags":36,"categories":42,"createdAt":27,"readingTime":28,"isUpdate":29},"18d396dc-e598-4f7a-8e38-f3a37694112d","175-malicious-npm-packages-used-in-phishing-campaign","175 Malicious NPM Packages Target Developers in Widespread Phishing Attack","Researchers Uncover 175 Malicious npm Packages with 26,000 Downloads in Credential Phishing Campaign","A significant software supply chain attack has been identified on the npm open-source repository, where researchers discovered 175 malicious packages that were downloaded approximately 26,000 times.
