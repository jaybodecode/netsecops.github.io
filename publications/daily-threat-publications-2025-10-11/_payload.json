Major themes include the active exploitation of a zero-day in Oracle E-Business Suite by the Cl0p ransomware group and the patching of a 13-year-old RCE flaw in Redis. Supply chain attacks remain a dominant threat, with malicious npm and Node.js packages targeting developers, and a Discord breach originating from a third-party vendor. SonicWall disclosed two major incidents: active exploitation of its VPNs by Akira ransomware and a full-scale breach of its Cloud Backup service affecting all customers. Additionally, new malware strains like 'Chaosbot' and the AI-powered 'MalTerminal' demonstrate evolving attacker TTPs.","2025-10-11",8,[10,34,52,67,82,97,109,121],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":24,"createdAt":26,"updatedAt":27,"readingTime":28,"cves":29,"isUpdate":31,"updateSummary":32,"updateContent":33},"255dbbaf-45ad-423c-9033-df19bd7f0c20","cl0p-ransomware-exploits-oracle-e-business-suite-zero-day-in-mass-attack","Cl0p Ransomware Exploits Oracle E-Business Suite Zero-Day in Mass Attack","Cl0p Ransomware Gang Exploits Unauthenticated RCE Zero-Day (CVE-2025-61882) in Oracle E-Business Suite","critical","The notorious Cl0p ransomware gang is conducting a widespread extortion campaign by exploiting a critical, unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-61882) in Oracle E-Business Suite. The campaign, active since at least August, involves Cl0p breaching vulnerable systems to steal data and then sending extortion emails to thousands of accounts. Oracle has released an emergency patch for the flaw, which affects versions 12.2.3 through 12.2.14, and is urging customers to update immediately.
