Major data breaches at financial firms 700Credit and Prosper Marketplace have exposed the sensitive information of over 18 million individuals. Concurrently, Apple and Google rushed to patch two actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in the WebKit engine. Other significant events include CISA's mandate to patch a critical GeoServer flaw, active attacks on Fortinet SSO vulnerabilities, and data exposures at SoundCloud and Pornhub. Ransomware continues to plague the healthcare sector with an attack on Fieldtex by the Akira group, while new malware campaigns target developers on GitHub.","2025-12-16",5,[10,30,51,70,88],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":26,"createdAt":28,"updatedAt":28,"readingTime":8,"isUpdate":29},"c3f9d6a8-43cb-44e6-9d47-07c5600788cc","soundcloud-and-pornhub-disclose-user-data-breaches","SoundCloud and Pornhub Confirm User Data Exposure in Separate Breaches, One Via Third-Party","SoundCloud and Pornhub Disclose Data Breaches; Pornhub Incident Linked to Third-Party Vendor Mixpanel","high","Both SoundCloud and Pornhub have confirmed security incidents exposing user data. SoundCloud suffered a direct breach of an ancillary service dashboard, resulting in the exfiltration of email addresses and public profile information for up to 28 million users (20% of its user base).
