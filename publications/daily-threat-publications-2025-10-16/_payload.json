Concurrently, Microsoft's October Patch Tuesday addresses over 170 flaws, including four actively exploited zero-days. Other major events include the disruption of a ransomware campaign using signed malware, the discovery of a Chinese APT targeting a Russian IT firm, a massive data breach affecting two major airlines, and the disclosure of critical flaws in industrial control systems.","2025-10-16",5,[10,31,49,66,88],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":24,"createdAt":26,"updatedAt":27,"readingTime":8,"isUpdate":28,"updateSummary":29,"updateContent":30},"56b670f7-cd05-425d-859b-1e4386e76e40","vietnam-airlines-hit-by-massive-data-breach-affecting-7-3m-customers","Vietnam Airlines Breach: 7.3M Customer Records Exposed in Salesforce Supply Chain Attack","Data of 7.3 Million Vietnam Airlines Customers Leaked in Attack by 'Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters'","high","Vietnam Airlines has suffered a massive data breach exposing the records of 7.3 million unique customers. The attack, revealed on October 11, 2025, is attributed to the 'Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters' hacking group, the same collective behind the recent Qantas breach. The compromise occurred in June 2025 when attackers gained access to the airline's Salesforce-based CRM platform. The stolen data, which includes 7.3 million unique email addresses and other personal details, was released in October.
