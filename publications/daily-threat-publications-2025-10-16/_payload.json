Concurrently, Microsoft's October Patch Tuesday addresses over 170 flaws, including four actively exploited zero-days. Other major events include the disruption of a ransomware campaign using signed malware, the discovery of a Chinese APT targeting a Russian IT firm, a massive data breach affecting two major airlines, and the disclosure of critical flaws in industrial control systems.","2025-10-16",3,[10,31,53],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":26,"createdAt":28,"readingTime":29,"isUpdate":30},"473606c9-f272-475b-87cf-94cbf3c8fdc8","microsoft-disrupts-vanilla-tempest-ransomware-campaign-by-revoking-certificates","Microsoft Thwarts Ransomware Campaign by Revoking 200+ Malicious Code-Signing Certificates","Microsoft Disrupts Vanilla Tempest (Vice Society) by Revoking Over 200 Code-Signing Certificates Used to Sign Fake Microsoft Teams Installers","high","Microsoft has taken decisive action to disrupt a ransomware campaign by the threat group Vanilla Tempest (also known as Vice Society), which has been targeting education and healthcare. The group was using over 200 fraudulently obtained code-signing certificates to sign counterfeit Microsoft Teams installers. These fake installers delivered the Oyster backdoor, which in turn deployed the Rhysida ransomware. By revoking the certificates from providers like DigiCert, SSL.com, and its own Trusted Signing service, Microsoft has significantly hindered the malware's ability to evade detection.",[18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25],"Ransomware","Vanilla Tempest","Vice Society","Rhysida","Code Signing","Microsoft Teams","Malware","Microsoft",[18,27,24],"Threat Actor","2025-10-16T15:00:00.000Z",5,false,{"id":32,"slug":33,"headline":34,"title":35,"severity":36,"excerpt":37,"tags":38,"categories":48,"createdAt":28,"readingTime":29,"cves":51,"cvssScore":52,"isUpdate":30},"ead93c2b-2c75-4ad8-b7b8-6945f0f2226c","two-cvss-10-flaws-disclosed-in-red-lion-industrial-rtus","Full Industrial Control: Two CVSS 10.0 Flaws Found in Red Lion ICS RTUs","Researchers Disclose Two CVSS 10.0 Vulnerabilities in Red Lion Industrial RTUs, Allowing Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution","critical","Security researchers have discovered and disclosed two critical vulnerabilities, both rated CVSS 10.0, in Red Lion Sixnet series industrial remote terminal units (RTUs).
