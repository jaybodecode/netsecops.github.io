Other major events include Google's patch for two actively exploited Android zero-days, a FinCEN report revealing over $2.1 billion in ransomware payments since 2022, and significant data breaches at universities and financial service providers linked to Cl0p and Akira ransomware gangs. The landscape is further defined by new malware threats like the BRICKSTORM backdoor and Albiriox Android trojan, and a White House executive order accelerating the transition to post-quantum cryptography.","2025-12-08",5,[10,32,51,72,89],{"id":11,"slug":12,"headline":13,"title":14,"severity":15,"excerpt":16,"tags":17,"categories":25,"createdAt":26,"updatedAt":27,"readingTime":28,"isUpdate":29,"updateSummary":30,"updateContent":31},"3bd3d619-d10f-4f4a-98b2-989045d5b364","marquis-software-supply-chain-breach-hits-dozens-of-us-banks","Supply Chain Breach at Vendor Marquis Exposes Data From Dozens of US Banks","Ransomware Attack on Marketing Vendor Marquis Software Solutions Leads to Major Data Breach for U.S. Banks and Credit Unions","high","A ransomware attack on Marquis Software Solutions, a marketing and data analytics vendor for the financial industry, has resulted in a significant supply chain data breach affecting dozens of U.S. banks and credit unions.
