      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Code-to-Cloud Attacks: Leaked GitHub Tokens Become Keys to the Kingdom</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>Security researchers at Wiz have detailed an emerging "code-to-cloud" attack vector where threat actors leverage compromised GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs) to pivot from code repositories directly into production cloud environments. By abusing the trust between GitHub and connected Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), attackers with even basic read permissions can discover secret names, then use write permissions to execute malicious GitHub Actions that exfiltrate CSP credentials. The attack is particularly stealthy as API calls to search for secret names are not logged by GitHub Enterprise, creating a major visibility gap for defenders.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Cloud Security, Supply Chain Attack, Vulnerability</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Analysis</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 6 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Discover the 'code-to-cloud' attack vector where threat actors use compromised GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs) to pivot into production cloud environments, exfiltrating secrets and gaining control.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> code-to-cloud-attack-vector-abuses-github-pats</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Tue, 09 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Tue, 09 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Tue, 09 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/code-to-cloud-attack-vector-abuses-github-pats/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>
