      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Sandworm's Failed Wiper Attack on Polish Grid Highlights Critical Infrastructure Risk</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>On December 29, 2025, the Russian-linked threat actor Sandworm launched a coordinated destructive cyberattack against approximately 30 Polish renewable energy facilities and a manufacturing company. The attackers exploited vulnerable internet-exposed Fortinet FortiGate devices that used default credentials and lacked MFA. After gaining access, they deployed wiper malware, including DynoWiper and LazyWiper, with the intent to cause widespread damage. While the attack was thwarted by EDR software at a major combined heat and power (CHP) plant and ultimately failed to disrupt the power grid, it caused permanent damage to some Industrial Control System (ICS) devices and underscored the significant risk of cyberattacks against distributed energy resources.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Industrial Control Systems, Cyberattack, Threat Actor</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Analysis of the Sandworm group's destructive wiper attack on Polish energy and manufacturing sectors, detailing the exploitation of FortiGate devices and the deployment of DynoWiper and LazyWiper malware.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> russian-linked-sandworm-targets-polish-energy-grid-with-wiper-malware</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/russian-linked-sandworm-targets-polish-energy-grid-with-wiper-malware/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Over 80% of Malicious Emails Now Use AI, Catalan Agency Warns</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A new report from the Catalan Cybersecurity Agency has issued a stark warning about the weaponization of artificial intelligence in phishing attacks. According to their 'Cybersecurity Outlook Report for 2026,' a staggering 82.6% of emails containing malicious links are now crafted using generative AI. The agency's director, Laura Caballero, stated that AI makes scams 'much more sophisticated' and 'almost perfect,' significantly lowering the bar for criminals and making fraudulent emails harder for the average user to detect. The agency advocates for using AI-powered defenses to combat the threat.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Informational</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Phishing, Threat Intelligence, Policy and Compliance</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Report</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 4 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A report from the Catalan Cybersecurity Agency reveals that over 82% of malicious emails utilize AI-generated content, significantly increasing the sophistication and difficulty of detecting phishing scams.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> over-80-percent-of-email-scams-now-use-ai-catalan-agency-warns</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/over-80-percent-of-email-scams-now-use-ai-catalan-agency-warns/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Supply Chain Attack: eScan Antivirus Update Server Compromised to Distribute Malware</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>Indian antivirus provider eScan, a product of MicroWorld Technologies, has suffered a supply chain attack. On January 20, 2026, a regional update server was compromised, causing it to push a malicious file named 'Reload.exe' to enterprise and consumer customers. According to security firm Morphisec, the malware disables the antivirus product by modifying the local HOSTS file to block future updates and then proceeds with a multi-stage infection to download additional payloads. While MicroWorld Technologies acknowledged the breach and isolated the server, it has disputed the 'supply chain attack' label. Affected users require a manual cleaning utility from eScan support for remediation.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Supply Chain Attack, Malware, Incident Response</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A supply chain attack on antivirus vendor eScan resulted in the distribution of malware to its customers through a compromised update server, disabling the security product.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> escan-antivirus-compromised-in-supply-chain-attack-delivers-malware</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Sun, 01 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Sun, 01 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Sun, 01 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/escan-antivirus-compromised-in-supply-chain-attack-delivers-malware/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Vishing Campaign Linked to ShinyHunters Bypasses MFA to Steal Data from SaaS Apps</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A sophisticated threat campaign, with links to the notorious extortion group ShinyHunters (UNC6240), is using voice phishing (vishing) and custom credential harvesting sites to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA). Tracked by Mandiant as UNC6661 and UNC6671, the attackers call employees, trick them into entering their single sign-on (SSO) credentials and MFA codes into a fake portal, and then register their own device for persistent access. The goal is to infiltrate corporate networks to steal data from SaaS applications like SharePoint and OneDrive for subsequent extortion. The campaign demonstrates a continued evolution in social engineering tactics designed to defeat modern security controls.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Phishing, Threat Actor, Data Breach</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A sophisticated vishing campaign linked to the ShinyHunters extortion group is targeting employees to steal SSO credentials and bypass MFA, leading to breaches of cloud SaaS platforms.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> shinyhunters-style-vishing-campaign-bypasses-mfa-to-breach-saas-platforms</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Sun, 01 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Sun, 01 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Sun, 01 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/shinyhunters-style-vishing-campaign-bypasses-mfa-to-breach-saas-platforms/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

Security experts are warning that such shutdowns create a period of heightened cybersecurity risk for the nation. With reduced staffing and coordination at key agencies like CISA, the government's ability to detect, respond to, and share intelligence about threats is diminished.
