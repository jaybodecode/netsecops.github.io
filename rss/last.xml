      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> React2Shell Zero-Day Exploited Within Hours by Chinese APTs, CISA Issues Emergency Directive</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A critical, maximum-severity (CVSS 10.0) remote code execution vulnerability in React Server Components, dubbed React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182), is being actively exploited by Chinese state-sponsored threat groups like Earth Lamia and Jackpot Panda. The flaw, caused by insecure deserialization in React's 'Flight' protocol, allows unauthenticated attackers to take full control of affected servers. The rapid weaponization, occurring just hours after disclosure, prompted the U.S. CISA to add the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog on December 5, 2025, mandating urgent patching for federal agencies. The availability of public PoCs and a Metasploit module has significantly increased the risk for organizations using affected versions of React, Next.js, and other dependent frameworks.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Vulnerability, Threat Actor, Cyberattack</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Advisory</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 6 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Analysis of the critical React2Shell RCE vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182, CVSS 10.0) actively exploited by Chinese APTs.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> New 'Benzona' Ransomware Emerges with Double-Extortion Tactics</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A new ransomware strain named 'Benzona' has been identified by security researchers at CYFIRMA. The malware operates on a double-extortion model, encrypting victim files with a '.benzona' extension while also exfiltrating sensitive data. Attackers leave a ransom note, 'RECOVERY_INFO.txt', which gives victims a 72-hour deadline to make contact via a Tor-based portal. Failure to pay results in the threat of leaking the stolen data on a public extortion site. Technical analysis shows Benzona is designed to cripple system recovery by deleting shadow copies and disabling Windows recovery features. Initial victims are from the automotive, digital services, and community sectors.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Ransomware, Malware</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Details on the new Benzona ransomware strain, which uses double-extortion, appends a .benzona extension, and actively disables Windows recovery features to impede restoration.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> new-benzona-ransomware-strain-uses-double-extortion-tactics</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Sat, 06 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Sat, 06 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Sat, 06 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/new-benzona-ransomware-strain-uses-double-extortion-tactics/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

The alert, issued on December 5, 2025, follows the large-scale 'Shai-Hulud 2.0' worm attack in late November that compromised over 700 packages. Despite cleanup efforts, malicious packages re-emerged as recently as December 1. The worm operated by stealing developer credentials to inject malicious 'preinstall' scripts into new package versions, which then exfiltrated secrets like API keys to public GitHub repositories. The advisory highlights ongoing risks and urges organizations to enhance supply chain security by verifying package integrity and auditing CI/CD pipelines.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Supply Chain Attack, Malware</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Advisory</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A security advisory warns of ongoing malicious activity in the NPM ecosystem following the Shai-Hulud 2.0 worm, which compromised hundreds of packages to steal developer secrets.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> ongoing-supply-chain-risk-in-npm-ecosystem-following-shai-hulud-worm</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Sat, 06 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Sat, 06 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Sat, 06 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/ongoing-supply-chain-risk-in-npm-ecosystem-following-shai-hulud-worm/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> CISA Exposes 'BRICKSTORM' Backdoor Used by Chinese State Actors to Infiltrate US Government</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), NSA, and Canadian Centre for Cyber Security have jointly exposed a sophisticated backdoor named 'BRICKSTORM'. According to the December 4, 2025 advisory, People's Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored actors are using this malware to target government and IT sector organizations. BRICKSTORM is designed for stealth and long-term persistence in both VMware vSphere and Windows environments. It employs multi-layered encrypted communications, including DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), to hide its C2 traffic. The advisory details an attack chain where actors used a web shell for initial access, moved laterally via RDP, and ultimately deployed BRICKSTORM on a VMware vCenter server to compromise domain controllers. Agencies are urged to hunt for this threat immediately.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Threat Actor, Malware, Cyberattack</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Advisory</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 6 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> CISA, NSA, and the Canadian Cyber Centre have issued a joint alert on BRICKSTORM, a stealthy backdoor used by Chinese state-sponsored actors to target government and IT sectors.
