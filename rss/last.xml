      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> New 'Herodotus' Android Trojan Mimics Human Typing to Defeat Biometric Security</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A new Android banking trojan, named 'Herodotus,' is being sold as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) and is designed to evade modern behavioral biometric security. According to researchers at Threat Fabric, the malware gains full control of a device via Accessibility Service abuse. Its key innovation is the ability to 'humanize' fraudulent actions by simulating realistic typing, introducing random delays between keystrokes. This allows it to perform automated on-device fraud, such as transferring funds, while appearing as a legitimate user. The malware, spread via smishing, has been observed targeting banking users in Italy and Brazil.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Malware, Mobile Security, Threat Intelligence</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Herodotus malware, Android banking trojan, Threat Fabric, MaaS, smishing, on-device fraud, behavioral biometrics, Accessibility Service abuse</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Researchers have discovered 'Herodotus,' a new Android banking trojan that mimics human typing with random delays to bypass behavioral biometric fraud detection systems.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> herodotus-android-malware-mimics-human-typing-to-bypass-security</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Thu, 30 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Thu, 30 Oct 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Thu, 30 Oct 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/herodotus-android-malware-mimics-human-typing-to-bypass-security/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>
