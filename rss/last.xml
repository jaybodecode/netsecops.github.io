      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Ransomware Attacks Surge 50% in 2025; Qilin Group Takes the Lead</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>Cybersecurity researchers report a staggering 50% increase in ransomware attacks in 2025, with over 5,000 incidents claimed on dark web leak sites by late October. This surge occurs amidst a significant realignment in the ransomware ecosystem, with formerly dominant groups fading while new and resurgent actors like Qilin take their place. The Qilin group has been particularly prolific, leading in victim counts for most of the past six months. The United States remains the most targeted nation, and the industrial sector is the most heavily impacted industry. PowerShell has become the primary tool for attackers, used in nearly 78% of observed campaigns.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Ransomware, Threat Actor, Threat Intelligence</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A 50% surge in ransomware attacks is reported for 2025, with the Qilin group emerging as a dominant threat actor.
