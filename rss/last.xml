The most critical, CVE-2025-62221, is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver that is confirmed to be under active exploitation. The flaw allows a local attacker to gain SYSTEM-level privileges. Due to its active use in attacks, CISA has added it to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, mandating federal agencies to patch by December 30, 2025. A second, publicly disclosed zero-day, CVE-2025-54100, an RCE in PowerShell, was also patched but is not known to be exploited.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Patch Management, Vulnerability</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Advisory</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Microsoft's December 2025 Patch Tuesday addresses 57 vulnerabilities, including the actively exploited zero-day CVE-2025-62221, a privilege escalation flaw in the Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> microsoft-patches-actively-exploited-zero-day-cve-2025-62221-december-2025</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Fri, 12 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Fri, 12 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/microsoft-patches-actively-exploited-zero-day-cve-2025-62221-december-2025/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

The report warns that ransomware groups are actively expanding into new geographic regions and industry sectors that have historically seen fewer attacks, often targeting those with less mature cyber defenses. The highly active LockBit ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group is a key driver of this trend.
