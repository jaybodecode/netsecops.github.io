The most critical, CVE-2025-62221, is a privilege escalation flaw in the Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver that is being actively exploited in the wild. This has prompted the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to add it to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, mandating a patch by December 30, 2025. The flaw allows a local, authenticated attacker to gain SYSTEM-level privileges. The update also patches other critical RCE flaws in Microsoft Office and publicly disclosed, but not exploited, bugs in PowerShell and GitHub Copilot.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Patch Management, Vulnerability, Security Operations</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Advisory</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Microsoft's December 2025 Patch Tuesday fixes an actively exploited zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-62221) in the Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver, along with 56 other flaws.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> microsoft-patches-actively-exploited-windows-zero-day-in-december-2025-update</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/microsoft-patches-actively-exploited-windows-zero-day-in-december-2025-update/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

The add-ons, which masqueraded as legitimate tools like VPNs and ad blockers, have been removed from the Firefox store. The malware employed a clever technique, hiding obfuscated JavaScript within the add-on's logo image file. This code would then contact command-and-control (C2) servers to download a final payload designed for hijacking affiliate links and committing ad fraud.

The group employs a structured and well-researched approach, sending highly credible phishing emails with fake invoices that impersonate professional services firms. To add legitimacy, the attackers often include forged prior email correspondence from a company executive authorizing the payment.

Attackers first compromised a third-party IT vendor in October 2025, using it as a pivot point to infiltrate the banks' networks. Over the following month, they exfiltrated vast amounts of financial data and personally identifiable information (PII), including national IDs and bank account numbers, before the breach was discovered in late November.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> AI Adoption Fuels 'Massive' Cloud Attack Surface Expansion, Palo Alto Networks Report Warns</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>Palo Alto Networks' 2025 'State of Cloud Security Report' reveals that the rapid adoption of AI is creating an unprecedented expansion of the cloud attack surface. The study, surveying 2,800 security leaders, found that 99% of organizations have had their AI systems attacked in the last year. The use of generative AI in coding is producing insecure code faster than security teams can remediate it, creating a significant risk gap. API attacks have surged by 41% year-over-year, and lenient identity and access management (IAM) remains a top vulnerability. The report calls for a unified, platform-based approach to cloud security to counter AI-weaponized threats.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Informational</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Cloud Security, Threat Intelligence, Policy and Compliance</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Report</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> cloud security report, AI security, Palo Alto Networks, cloud attack surface, API attacks, generative AI risks, IAM security, CNAPP</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Palo Alto Networks' 2025 cloud security report finds that rapid AI adoption is creating a massive surge in cloud risks, with 99% of organizations reporting attacks on their AI systems.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> palo-alto-networks-report-ai-driving-massive-expansion-of-cloud-attack-surface</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Wed, 17 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Wed, 17 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Wed, 17 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/palo-alto-networks-report-ai-driving-massive-expansion-of-cloud-attack-surface/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> New 'ConsentFix' Phishing Attack Hijacks Microsoft Accounts, Bypassing MFA via Azure CLI Abuse</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A novel and sophisticated phishing attack dubbed 'ConsentFix' allows attackers to hijack Microsoft accounts without stealing passwords or bypassing multi-factor authentication (MFA). Discovered by Push Security, the browser-native attack tricks users into completing a fake verification process that involves copying a URL containing a sensitive OAuth authorization code from their browser's address bar and pasting it into the attacker's phishing page. The attacker then uses this code to authenticate as the user via the legitimate and trusted Microsoft Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI). Because the Azure CLI is a first-party app, it bypasses many consent restrictions, granting the attacker full account access. The technique is active and circumvents even phishing-resistant authentication like passkeys.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Phishing, Cloud Security, Threat Actor</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Analysis</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> ConsentFix attack, ClickFix, OAuth phishing, Azure CLI exploit, MFA bypass, Microsoft account hijack, Push Security, browser-native attack</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A new 'ConsentFix' phishing attack bypasses MFA to hijack Microsoft accounts by tricking users into pasting an OAuth authorization code, which is then used with the trusted Azure CLI.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> new-consentfix-phishing-attack-bypasses-mfa-to-hijack-microsoft-accounts</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Wed, 17 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Wed, 17 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Wed, 17 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/new-consentfix-phishing-attack-bypasses-mfa-to-hijack-microsoft-accounts/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Storm-0249 Evolves: Access Broker Now Deploys Ransomware with Advanced Stealth Tactics</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>The initial access broker (IAB) known as Storm-0249 is evolving its tactics, moving beyond simply selling network access to actively participating in malware deployment. According to ReliaQuest, the group now uses more sophisticated techniques, including DLL side-loading and fileless PowerShell execution, to facilitate ransomware attacks directly.
