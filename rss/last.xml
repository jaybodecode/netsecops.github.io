      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Microsoft Patches Actively Exploited Windows Zero-Day in Final 2025 Update</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>Microsoft's December 2025 Patch Tuesday addresses 57 vulnerabilities, including three zero-days. The most critical, CVE-2025-62221, is a privilege escalation flaw in the Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver that is being actively exploited in the wild. This has prompted the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to add it to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, mandating a patch by December 30, 2025. The flaw allows a local, authenticated attacker to gain SYSTEM-level privileges. The update also patches other critical RCE flaws in Microsoft Office and publicly disclosed, but not exploited, bugs in PowerShell and GitHub Copilot.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Patch Management, Vulnerability, Security Operations</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Advisory</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Microsoft's December 2025 Patch Tuesday fixes an actively exploited zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-62221) in the Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver, along with 56 other flaws.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> microsoft-patches-actively-exploited-windows-zero-day-in-december-2025-update</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/microsoft-patches-actively-exploited-windows-zero-day-in-december-2025-update/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Phishing Surge Hits Microsoft 365 via OAuth Device Code Abuse</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>Security researchers report a significant rise in phishing campaigns abusing the Microsoft OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant to compromise Microsoft 365 accounts. Both state-aligned groups like UNK_AcademicFlare and financially motivated actors like TA2723 are using this 'device code' phishing technique, often facilitated by Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) kits like SquarePhish2. The attacks trick users into entering a short device code on Microsoft's legitimate 'microsoft.com/devicelogin' page, which inadvertently grants the attacker's malicious application a valid access token and persistent access to the victim's account.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Phishing, Threat Actor, Cloud Security</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Threat actors are increasingly abusing the Microsoft OAuth device code flow in sophisticated phishing campaigns to gain unauthorized access to Microsoft 365 accounts.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> threat-actors-abuse-oauth-device-code-flow-in-microsoft-365-phishing-surge</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/threat-actors-abuse-oauth-device-code-flow-in-microsoft-365-phishing-surge/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> "GhostPoster" Malware Infects 50,000+ Firefox Users via Malicious Add-ons</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A stealthy malware campaign named "GhostPoster" has infected over 50,000 Mozilla Firefox users by distributing 17 malicious browser extensions. The add-ons, which masqueraded as legitimate tools like VPNs and ad blockers, have been removed from the Firefox store. The malware employed a clever technique, hiding obfuscated JavaScript within the add-on's logo image file. This code would then contact command-and-control (C2) servers to download a final payload designed for hijacking affiliate links and committing ad fraud. The campaign used evasion techniques like randomized and delayed C2 callbacks to avoid detection.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Malware, Cyberattack</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> The GhostPoster malware campaign has infected over 50,000 Mozilla Firefox users by hiding malicious JavaScript inside the logo files of 17 browser extensions.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> ghostposter-malware-infects-50000-firefox-users-via-malicious-add-ons</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/ghostposter-malware-infects-50000-firefox-users-via-malicious-add-ons/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

The group employs a structured and well-researched approach, sending highly credible phishing emails with fake invoices that impersonate professional services firms. To add legitimacy, the attackers often include forged prior email correspondence from a company executive authorizing the payment. The group utilizes a large network of US-based mule accounts for cashing out, indicating a well-organized and persistent financial threat.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Threat Actor, Phishing, Cyberattack</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A persistent and organized Business Email Compromise (BEC) group named Scripted Sparrow is targeting finance teams with convincing phishing emails and fake invoices.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> scripted-sparrow-bec-group-targets-finance-teams-with-disciplined-phishing-attacks</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/scripted-sparrow-bec-group-targets-finance-teams-with-disciplined-phishing-attacks/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> "IRLeaks" Supply Chain Attack Hits Iranian Banks, Exposing Millions of Customer Records</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A major supply chain attack dubbed "IRLeaks" has resulted in a significant data breach affecting several prominent Iranian banks and millions of their customers. Attackers first compromised a third-party IT vendor in October 2025, using it as a pivot point to infiltrate the banks' networks. Over the following month, they exfiltrated vast amounts of financial data and personally identifiable information (PII), including national IDs and bank account numbers, before the breach was discovered in late November. The incident highlights the critical risks associated with third-party vendor security and inadequate patch management.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Data Breach, Supply Chain Attack, Cyberattack</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> The "IRLeaks" data breach exposed millions of Iranian bank customers' data after attackers compromised a third-party IT service provider, highlighting significant supply chain risks.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> irleaks-breach-at-iranian-banks-exposes-millions-via-third-party-vendor</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/irleaks-breach-at-iranian-banks-exposes-millions-via-third-party-vendor/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

Attackers can now compromise cloud environments in minutes, while defenders take weeks to remediate critical issues. The report, which surveyed over 2,800 executives, highlights that identity and APIs are the top risk vectors, with 99% of organizations reporting at least one attack on their AI systems in the past year.
