      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> React2Shell Flaw Now a Gateway for Ransomware Attacks</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>The critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability known as React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182) is now being actively and widely exploited by multiple threat actors. Initially used for deploying cryptominers and backdoors, the attacks have escalated significantly. Microsoft reports hundreds of compromised machines across various organizations. Most alarmingly, security firm S-RM has confirmed an incident where the flaw was used as the initial access vector to deploy Weaxor ransomware, a likely rebrand of the Mallox family, in under a minute. This development marks a shift from opportunistic attacks to targeted, financially motivated cyber extortion, demonstrating the high-risk and tangible impact of this easily exploitable vulnerability on corporate networks.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Vulnerability, Ransomware, Cyberattack</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Advisory</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 6 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Active and widespread exploitation of the critical React2Shell vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182) has escalated to include ransomware deployment, with attackers using the flaw as an initial access vector.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> react2shell-vulnerability-exploited-for-ransomware-deployment</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Fri, 19 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Fri, 19 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Fri, 19 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/react2shell-vulnerability-exploited-for-ransomware-deployment/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Microsoft Patches Actively Exploited Windows Zero-Day in Final 2025 Update</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>Microsoft's December 2025 Patch Tuesday addresses 57 vulnerabilities, including three zero-days. The most critical, CVE-2025-62221, is a privilege escalation flaw in the Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver that is being actively exploited in the wild. This has prompted the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to add it to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, mandating a patch by December 30, 2025. The flaw allows a local, authenticated attacker to gain SYSTEM-level privileges. The update also patches other critical RCE flaws in Microsoft Office and publicly disclosed, but not exploited, bugs in PowerShell and GitHub Copilot.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Patch Management, Vulnerability, Security Operations</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Advisory</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Microsoft's December 2025 Patch Tuesday fixes an actively exploited zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-62221) in the Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver, along with 56 other flaws.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> microsoft-patches-actively-exploited-windows-zero-day-in-december-2025-update</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/microsoft-patches-actively-exploited-windows-zero-day-in-december-2025-update/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

The add-ons, which masqueraded as legitimate tools like VPNs and ad blockers, have been removed from the Firefox store. The malware employed a clever technique, hiding obfuscated JavaScript within the add-on's logo image file. This code would then contact command-and-control (C2) servers to download a final payload designed for hijacking affiliate links and committing ad fraud.

The group employs a structured and well-researched approach, sending highly credible phishing emails with fake invoices that impersonate professional services firms.

Attackers first compromised a third-party IT vendor in October 2025, using it as a pivot point to infiltrate the banks' networks. Over the following month, they exfiltrated vast amounts of financial data and personally identifiable information (PII), including national IDs and bank account numbers, before the breach was discovered in late November.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> SANS Report: OT/ICS Cyber Incidents Rising, 40% Cause Downtime</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A new report from the SANS Institute highlights a dangerous trend in the security of Operational Technology (OT) and Industrial Control Systems (ICS). The '2025 State of ICS/OT Security Report' found that over 21% of organizations experienced a cyber incident in their OT environment in the past year. Of those, 40.3% suffered operational downtime. Ransomware was a primary cause, responsible for 37.9% of incidents, with unauthorized external connections being the top initial access vector. The report also points to a significant 'resilience gap,' with recovery times often exceeding one month.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Informational</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Industrial Control Systems, Threat Intelligence, Ransomware</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Report</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> The 2025 SANS State of ICS/OT Security Report finds that over 21% of organizations faced an OT cyber incident, with 40% suffering downtime, largely driven by ransomware and insecure remote access.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> sans-report-shows-rising-ot-ics-cyber-incidents-driven-by-ransomware</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Fri, 21 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Fri, 21 Nov 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Update Count:</strong> 1</p><p><strong>Update History:</strong> 1 update recorded</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/sans-report-shows-rising-ot-ics-cyber-incidents-driven-by-ransomware/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> 2025: The Year Cybersecurity 'Crossed the AI Rubicon'</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>According to analysis published on December 14, 2025, the year 2025 represents a fundamental and irreversible turning point for the cybersecurity industry. The widespread integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into both offensive and defensive strategies has permanently altered the threat landscape. Key trends include the rise of 'agentic AI' capable of autonomous attacks, adaptive threats that change tactics in real-time, and a surge in highly convincing, AI-generated phishing and deepfake content. While defenders are also adopting AI, the 'great acceleration' in threat complexity is forcing a complete rethink of security playbooks.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Informational</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Threat Intelligence, Other</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Analysis</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A 2025 year-in-review analysis concludes that the integration of artificial intelligence into both cyberattacks and defense strategies has permanently altered the threat landscape.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> 2025-the-year-ai-redefines-cyberattacks-and-defense</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Sun, 14 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Sun, 14 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Thu, 18 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Update Count:</strong> 1</p><p><strong>Update History:</strong> 1 update recorded</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/2025-the-year-ai-redefines-cyberattacks-and-defense/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>
