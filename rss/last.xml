      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> AWS Patches 'CodeBreach' Flaw, Averting Massive GitHub Supply Chain Attack</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has remediated a critical vulnerability in its AWS CodeBuild service, dubbed 'CodeBreach' by Wiz researchers. The flaw, which stemmed from a misconfigured webhook filter, could have allowed unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious code into the build processes of major open-source projects, including the AWS JavaScript SDK. An exploit could have granted attackers administrative control over key GitHub repositories, creating a catastrophic supply chain risk for the millions of applications and cloud environments that depend on these libraries. The vulnerability was discovered following a separate, failed attack attempt, highlighting the real-world threat. AWS has since patched the issue and implemented global hardening measures.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Supply Chain Attack, Cloud Security, Vulnerability</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Advisory</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 7 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> AWS has patched a critical 'CodeBreach' vulnerability in its CodeBuild service that could have enabled a massive supply chain attack by allowing attackers to inject malicious code into core GitHub repositories like the AWS JavaScript SDK.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> aws-codebuild-codebreach-supply-chain-vulnerability</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/aws-codebuild-codebreach-supply-chain-vulnerability/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Everest Ransomware Claims 900GB Data Theft from Automaker Nissan</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>The Russia-linked Everest ransomware group has claimed a significant data breach against Japanese automotive giant Nissan Motor Corporation. On January 10, 2026, the group added Nissan to its dark web leak site, asserting they had exfiltrated approximately 900 gigabytes of sensitive internal files. To back their claims, Everest published screenshots showing folder structures related to marketing, sales, manufacturing designs, and financial records, primarily concerning Nissan's North American operations. This incident represents a classic double-extortion attack, where the threat actors aim to pressure the victim into paying a ransom to prevent the public release of stolen data. Nissan has not yet confirmed the breach, which follows several other recent cyberattacks against the company.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Ransomware, Data Breach, Cyberattack</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 6 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> The Everest ransomware group claims to have breached automaker Nissan, exfiltrating 900GB of sensitive data and threatening to leak it on their dark web site in a double-extortion attack.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> everest-ransomware-claims-major-breach-at-nissan</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/everest-ransomware-claims-major-breach-at-nissan/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

The attack, which has since been patched by Microsoft, required only a single click on a malicious link. By chaining together several techniques, including prompt injection via a URL parameter and bypassing security filters with a 'double request' trick, an attacker could take control of the AI assistant's session. This allowed them to issue hidden commands to summarize and exfiltrate data, such as conversation history and personal files, without the user's knowledge.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> NPM Supply Chain Attacks Evolve from Typosquatting to Industrialized Takeovers</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>An analysis from CSO Online highlights a major strategic shift in software supply chain attacks targeting the npm ecosystem. Threat actors have moved beyond simple typosquatting to industrialized campaigns focused on compromising the accounts of legitimate package maintainers. These new attacks use phishing to steal developer credentials or access tokens, which are then used to publish malicious updates to widely-used, trusted packages. This makes the attacks far stealthier and more impactful. Campaigns are also becoming 'CI-aware,' designed to activate only within automated build environments to steal production secrets, marking a significant escalation in the threat to modern development pipelines.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Supply Chain Attack, Threat Intelligence, Security Operations</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Analysis</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 7 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A strategic analysis reveals that npm software supply chain attacks have evolved from simple typosquatting to industrialized campaigns involving the takeover of legitimate maintainer accounts to push malicious updates.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> the-industrialization-of-npm-supply-chain-attacks</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/the-industrialization-of-npm-supply-chain-attacks/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>
