To back their claims, Everest published screenshots showing folder structures related to marketing, sales, manufacturing designs, and financial records, primarily concerning Nissan's North American operations. This incident represents a classic double-extortion attack, where the threat actors aim to pressure the victim into paying a ransom to prevent the public release of stolen data.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> New 'Reprompt' Attack Steals Data from Microsoft Copilot with a Single Click</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>Security researchers at Varonis have discovered a novel attack technique called 'Reprompt' that allows attackers to silently steal sensitive data from a user's Microsoft Copilot Personal session. The attack, which has since been patched by Microsoft, required only a single click on a malicious link. By chaining together several techniques, including prompt injection via a URL parameter and bypassing security filters with a 'double request' trick, an attacker could take control of the AI assistant's session. This allowed them to issue hidden commands to summarize and exfiltrate data, such as conversation history and personal files, without the user's knowledge. The vulnerability did not affect the enterprise version of Copilot.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Vulnerability, Phishing, Cloud Security</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Analysis</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 6 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Researchers discovered the 'Reprompt' attack, a single-click method to silently steal data from Microsoft Copilot Personal by hijacking the AI session.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> GlassWorm Malware Pivots to Attack macOS Developers via Malicious VS Code Extensions</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>The GlassWorm malware campaign has evolved, now specifically targeting macOS developers through malicious extensions for Visual Studio Code and OpenVSX. This new wave of attacks, detailed in a security digest from Acronis, uses a self-propagating worm to deliver its payload. The malware embeds an encrypted payload within JavaScript files, uses a 15-minute execution delay to evade sandboxes, and establishes persistence using LaunchAgents. The primary goal of GlassWorm is to steal a wide range of developer-centric data, including credentials for GitHub and npm, browser data, and information from over 50 different cryptocurrency wallets, highlighting a significant supply chain threat.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Malware, Supply Chain Attack, Mobile Security</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 6 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> The GlassWorm malware campaign is now targeting macOS developers with malicious Visual Studio Code extensions to steal credentials and cryptocurrency wallet data, posing a software supply chain risk.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> glassworm-malware-targets-macos-developers-via-vs-code-extensions</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/glassworm-malware-targets-macos-developers-via-vs-code-extensions/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> NPM Supply Chain Attacks Evolve from Typosquatting to Industrialized Takeovers</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>An analysis from CSO Online highlights a major strategic shift in software supply chain attacks targeting the npm ecosystem. Threat actors have moved beyond simple typosquatting to industrialized campaigns focused on compromising the accounts of legitimate package maintainers. These new attacks use phishing to steal developer credentials or access tokens, which are then used to publish malicious updates to widely-used, trusted packages. This makes the attacks far stealthier and more impactful. Campaigns are also becoming 'CI-aware,' designed to activate only within automated build environments to steal production secrets, marking a significant escalation in the threat to modern development pipelines.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Supply Chain Attack, Threat Intelligence, Security Operations</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Analysis</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 7 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A strategic analysis reveals that npm software supply chain attacks have evolved from simple typosquatting to industrialized campaigns involving the takeover of legitimate maintainer accounts to push malicious updates.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> the-industrialization-of-npm-supply-chain-attacks</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/the-industrialization-of-npm-supply-chain-attacks/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>
