In 2025, the agency updated 59 entries to indicate that the flaws were being used in ransomware attacks, but it did not issue any notifications for these changes. Security experts argue that this lack of communication is a significant missed opportunity for defenders, who use the ransomware designation as a key factor in prioritizing patching.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Informational</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Policy and Compliance, Threat Intelligence, Vulnerability</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 4 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> An analysis of the criticism CISA is facing for silently updating its KEV catalog to flag 59 vulnerabilities as used in ransomware attacks without public notification.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> cisa-under-fire-for-quietly-updating-ransomware-vulnerability-data</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Wed, 04 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Wed, 04 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Wed, 04 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/cisa-under-fire-for-quietly-updating-ransomware-vulnerability-data/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>
