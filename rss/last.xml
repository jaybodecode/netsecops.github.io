The attackers exploited vulnerable internet-exposed Fortinet FortiGate devices that used default credentials and lacked MFA. After gaining access, they deployed wiper malware, including DynoWiper and LazyWiper, with the intent to cause widespread damage. While the attack was thwarted by EDR software at a major combined heat and power (CHP) plant and ultimately failed to disrupt the power grid, it caused permanent damage to some Industrial Control System (ICS) devices and underscored the significant risk of cyberattacks against distributed energy resources.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Industrial Control Systems, Cyberattack, Threat Actor</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Analysis of the Sandworm group's destructive wiper attack on Polish energy and manufacturing sectors, detailing the exploitation of FortiGate devices and the deployment of DynoWiper and LazyWiper malware.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> russian-linked-sandworm-targets-polish-energy-grid-with-wiper-malware</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/russian-linked-sandworm-targets-polish-energy-grid-with-wiper-malware/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Warning: Malicious ChatGPT Chrome Extensions Steal Session Tokens to Hijack Accounts</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>Researchers have identified 16 malicious Google Chrome extensions that masquerade as helpful tools for OpenAI's ChatGPT. Once installed, these extensions inject malicious scripts into the ChatGPT web application. The scripts are designed to monitor outbound requests, intercept sensitive data such as authorization details and session tokens, and exfiltrate them to an attacker-controlled server. This allows the attackers to hijack active user sessions, granting them full access to the victim's account and chat history.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Malware, Phishing, Cloud Security</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 4 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Researchers have identified 16 malicious Google Chrome extensions that masquerade as ChatGPT tools to inject scripts, steal session tokens, and hijack user accounts.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> malicious-chatgpt-chrome-extensions-hijack-user-sessions</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/malicious-chatgpt-chrome-extensions-hijack-user-sessions/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

The investigation, conducted by security firm Wiz, not only uncovered the data exposure but also revealed systemic security flaws, such as a lack of rate-limiting on agent registration. The breach also provided a skewed insight into the platform's user base, showing that its 1.5 million 'agents' were owned by only 17,000 human users.

The campaign, observed by HarfangLab in January 2026, uses phishing emails with macro-laced Excel files as an initial vector. The malware is notable for its modularity and its use of legitimate public services like GitHub, Google Drive, and Telegram for C2 and payload delivery, a technique to evade detection. Researchers suspect the attackers may have used Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in the development of their sophisticated tooling, marking a potential new trend in malware creation.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Threat Actor, Malware, Phishing</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A new Farsi-speaking threat actor, RedKitten, is targeting human rights NGOs with a sophisticated modular malware that uses public services for C2 and may have been developed with AI assistance.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> iran-linked-redkitten-campaign-targets-human-rights-ngos</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Sun, 01 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Sun, 01 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Mon, 02 Feb 2026 12:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Update Count:</strong> 1</p><p><strong>Update History:</strong> 1 update recorded</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/iran-linked-redkitten-campaign-targets-human-rights-ngos/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Attacks on Industrial Environments Doubled in 2025, Report Warns</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A new report from cybersecurity firm Cyble reveals a dramatic escalation in threats targeting industrial environments. According to its Annual Threat Landscape Report 2025, exploits against industrial technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) systems almost doubled last year. The report, published on January 15, 2026, documented nearly 6,000 ransomware attacks and identified numerous vulnerabilities in internet-exposed assets across critical infrastructure. Cyble predicts that in 2026, attackers will increasingly target exposed Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and SCADA systems. This trend poses a significant risk to major global events, such as the 2026 Winter Olympics, where interconnected vendor systems create a rich target environment for disruption and extortion.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Industrial Control Systems, Cyberattack, Threat Intelligence</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Report</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 7 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A new report from Cyble finds that cyberattacks targeting industrial control systems (ICS) and operational technology (OT) nearly doubled in 2025, with attackers predicted to focus on exposed HMI and SCADA systems.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> industrial-control-systems-face-escalating-cyber-threats</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Update Count:</strong> 1</p><p><strong>Update History:</strong> 1 update recorded</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/industrial-control-systems-face-escalating-cyber-threats/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>
