      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Nationwide Outage: BridgePay Payment Gateway Confirms Ransomware Attack Crippled Production Systems</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>U.S. payment gateway provider BridgePay Network Solutions has confirmed a ransomware attack was the cause of a massive service outage that began on February 6, 2026. The attack took down numerous production systems, including the BridgePay Gateway API, virtual terminals, and hosted payment pages, disrupting credit and debit card processing for merchants across the United States in sectors like retail, hospitality, and government. Many businesses were forced to revert to cash-only operations. BridgePay has engaged the FBI and U.S. Secret Service. While the company states that an initial investigation suggests no usable payment card data was exposed due to encryption, a timeline for full service restoration has not been provided, and the process is expected to be lengthy.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Ransomware, Cyberattack, Data Breach</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 4 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> BridgePay Network Solutions, a major U.S. payment processor, confirms a ransomware attack is behind a nationwide outage affecting merchants in retail, hospitality, and government.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> ransomware-attack-cripples-bridgepay-payment-gateway-causing-nationwide-outages</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Sun, 08 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Sun, 08 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Sun, 08 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/ransomware-attack-cripples-bridgepay-payment-gateway-causing-nationwide-outages/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> CISA Issues Directive 26-02, Mandating Removal of End-of-Support Edge Devices from Federal Networks</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-02, a mandate requiring U.S. federal civilian agencies to identify, and ultimately decommission, all network edge devices that have reached their end-of-support (EOS) date. The directive addresses the 'disproportionate and unacceptable risks' posed by unpatched hardware and software, which are frequently targeted by advanced threat actors. The BOD establishes a multi-phase timeline: agencies have three months to inventory devices on CISA's EOS list, 12 months to decommission devices already past their EOS date, and 18 months to replace all identified EOS equipment. This move aims to reduce the federal government's attack surface and drive down technical debt.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Policy and Compliance, Regulatory, Patch Management</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Advisory</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 3 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> CISA issues Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-02, compelling U.S. federal agencies to remove all end-of-support (EOS) network edge devices to mitigate security risks.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> cisa-mandates-removal-of-unsupported-edge-devices-from-federal-networks</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Sun, 08 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Sun, 08 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Sun, 08 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/cisa-mandates-removal-of-unsupported-edge-devices-from-federal-networks/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Notepad++ Supply Chain Attack Attributed to Chinese APT 'Lotus Blossom' (Billbug)</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A sophisticated supply chain attack that hijacked the update mechanism of the popular Notepad++ text editor has been attributed with medium confidence to 'Lotus Blossom' (also known as Billbug), a China-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) group. The attack, which ran from June to December 2025, compromised Notepad++'s hosting provider, allowing the attackers to selectively redirect update traffic for older, vulnerable versions of the software. The threat actors deployed a custom backdoor named 'Chrysalis' and utilized a multi-stage infection chain involving Metasploit and Cobalt Strike. The Notepad++ developer has since secured the update infrastructure and patched the vulnerability in version 8.8.9.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Supply Chain Attack, Threat Actor, Malware</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 4 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A sophisticated supply chain attack on Notepad++ has been attributed to the Chinese APT group Lotus Blossom (Billbug), which deployed a custom 'Chrysalis' backdoor.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> notepad-plus-plus-supply-chain-attack-attributed-to-chinese-apt-group-lotus-blossom</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Sun, 08 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Sun, 08 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Sun, 08 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/notepad-plus-plus-supply-chain-attack-attributed-to-chinese-apt-group-lotus-blossom/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> EDR-Killer Malware Weaponizes Decade-Old EnCase Driver in BYOVD Attacks</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>Threat actors are using a new EDR-killing malware that leverages a 'Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver' (BYOVD) technique to disable endpoint security products. Researchers at Huntress discovered the malware during an intrusion that began with compromised SonicWall SSL VPN credentials. The attackers abuse `EnPortv.sys`, a legitimate but long-revoked kernel driver from Guidance Software's EnCase forensic toolkit. Despite its certificate being revoked in 2010, a gap in Windows' driver signature enforcement allows it to be loaded, granting the attackers kernel-level privileges. The malware uses these privileges to terminate 59 different processes associated with major EDR vendors like CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, and Microsoft, clearing the way for ransomware deployment.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Malware, Ransomware, Threat Actor</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 4 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A new EDR-killing malware uses a 'Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver' (BYOVD) technique, abusing a revoked driver from EnCase ('EnPortv.sys') to disable security products.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> attackers-weaponize-decade-old-encase-driver-to-terminate-edr-products</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Sun, 08 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Sun, 08 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Sun, 08 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/attackers-weaponize-decade-old-encase-driver-to-terminate-edr-products/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

Attackers impersonate internal IT staff, tricking employees into visiting a credential harvesting site and providing their username, password, and real-time MFA code. This allows the attackers to enroll their own device and gain persistent access. Recent high-profile victims include Panera Bread (5.1 million records leaked), Match Group (Tinder, Hinge), Bumble, and Harvard University's alumni department (115,000 records exposed). The group, operating as 'Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters,' has reportedly prepared infrastructure to target over 100 additional organizations.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Phishing, Data Breach, Threat Actor</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> The ShinyHunters cybercrime group is using sophisticated voice-phishing (vishing) attacks to bypass MFA and breach major companies like Panera Bread, Match Group, and Harvard University.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> shinyhunters-group-bypasses-mfa-in-widespread-social-engineering-attacks</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Sun, 08 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Sun, 08 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Sun, 08 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/shinyhunters-group-bypasses-mfa-in-widespread-social-engineering-attacks/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

The espionage campaign, dubbed 'Operation Neusploit,' targets government, military, and transport organizations in Europe with sophisticated phishing lures. The flaw is a security feature bypass that attackers trigger with malicious RTF documents. The multi-stage infection chain deploys backdoors like 'MiniDoor' for email exfiltration and a C++ implant called 'BeardShell,' using legitimate cloud services like filen.io for C2 to evade detection. Microsoft released an out-of-band patch on January 26, 2026, and organizations are urged to apply it immediately.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Threat Actor, Vulnerability, Phishing</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Russian APT28 (Fancy Bear) is actively exploiting the recently patched Microsoft Office vulnerability CVE-2026-21509 in a widespread espionage campaign targeting Europe.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> apt28-exploits-freshly-patched-office-flaw-in-espionage-campaign</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Sun, 08 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Sun, 08 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Sun, 08 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/apt28-exploits-freshly-patched-office-flaw-in-espionage-campaign/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Malicious VS Code Extension 'ClawdBot Agent' Deployed ScreenConnect RAT via Marketplace</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A malicious extension named 'ClawdBot Agent' was discovered in the official Visual Studio Code Marketplace, impersonating a popular AI coding assistant to trick developers. The trojanized extension was fully functional, helping it evade suspicion while its malicious payload executed in the background upon VS Code launch. The attack chain fetched a remote configuration file that initiated the deployment of a weaponized version of the legitimate remote support tool, ConnectWise ScreenConnect, effectively turning it into a Remote Access Tool (RAT). This gave attackers full remote control over compromised developer machines. The extension was quickly removed by Microsoft, but the incident highlights the growing risk of supply chain attacks targeting developer ecosystems.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Supply Chain Attack, Malware, Cloud Security</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 4 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A malicious VS Code Marketplace extension, 'ClawdBot Agent,' impersonated an AI assistant to trick developers into installing a RAT, giving attackers full remote control.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> malicious-clawdbot-agent-in-vs-code-marketplace-deployed-rat-malware</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Sun, 08 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Sun, 08 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Sun, 08 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/malicious-clawdbot-agent-in-vs-code-marketplace-deployed-rat-malware/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> New 'Milkyway' Ransomware Strain Discovered Targeting Windows Systems</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>Cybersecurity firm CYFIRMA has identified a new ransomware strain named 'Milkyway' found on underground forums. The malware is designed to target Windows environments, systematically encrypting files and appending a '.milkyway' extension. After encryption, it displays a full-screen ransom note that threatens to leak stolen data and report the victim to tax and law enforcement authorities if the ransom is not paid. As with most ransomware, recovery without paying the ransom depends on the availability of secure, offline backups, as decryption is typically not possible.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Ransomware, Malware</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 4 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Security firm CYFIRMA has discovered a new ransomware family called Milkyway that targets Windows, encrypts files with a '.milkyway' extension, and threatens to leak data.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> threat-intelligence-report-reveals-new-milkyway-ransomware-strain</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Sat, 07 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Sat, 07 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Sat, 07 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/threat-intelligence-report-reveals-new-milkyway-ransomware-strain/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

Prioritizing stealth, Pulsar RAT uses fileless techniques, deploying its payload directly into system memory to evade disk-based antivirus scanning. It leverages legitimate Windows processes to blend in with normal activity, allowing for long-term persistence. Pulsar RAT is a powerful espionage tool with features like encrypted C2, credential harvesting, anti-debugging, and the ability to access webcams and microphones, making it a significant threat for silent, long-term network exploitation.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Malware, Threat Intelligence</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Analysis</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A technical analysis of Pulsar RAT, a modular and highly covert Remote Administration Trojan for Windows that uses fileless, in-memory techniques to evade detection.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> researchers-detail-covert-pulsar-remote-administration-trojan</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Sat, 07 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Sat, 07 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Sat, 07 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/researchers-detail-covert-pulsar-remote-administration-trojan/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Attackers Abuse Windows Screensaver (.scr) Files to Drop RMM Tools for Persistent Access</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A novel attack technique has been observed where threat actors are abusing Windows screensaver (.scr) files as droppers for legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools. By tricking users into executing a malicious screensaver file, attackers can bypass security controls that might block direct RMM installation. Because .scr files are executables, they can be weaponized to install the RMM software, providing the attacker with persistent, stealthy remote access to the compromised machine for data theft, surveillance, or lateral movement. This method highlights the ongoing trend of attackers using living-off-the-land techniques.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Malware, Phishing, Security Operations</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A novel attack vector uses malicious Windows screensaver (.scr) files to act as droppers for legitimate RMM tools, allowing threat actors to gain persistent remote access.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> threat-actors-deploy-rmm-tools-using-windows-screensaver-files</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Sat, 07 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Sat, 07 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Sat, 07 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/threat-actors-deploy-rmm-tools-using-windows-screensaver-files/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Evolving Telegram Phishing Campaign Tricks Users into Approving Account Takeover</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A sophisticated phishing campaign targeting Telegram users has re-emerged, using the platform's own features to hijack accounts. As reported by CYFIRMA, the attack tricks users with fake security alerts, directing them to a malicious site or bot that mimics an official Telegram service. The core of the attack is manipulating the user into approving a legitimate-looking authorization prompt for a 'new device' within their own Telegram app. Approving this prompt grants the attacker's device full session access, enabling them to take over the account, read private chats, and exfiltrate data. The campaign highlights the effectiveness of social engineering attacks that exploit user trust in a platform's native functions.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Phishing, Mobile Security</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A sophisticated phishing campaign targeting Telegram users has re-emerged, abusing the platform's own authorization prompts to trick users into granting attackers access to their accounts.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> telegram-phishing-campaign-re-emerges-abusing-authorization-prompts</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Sat, 07 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Sat, 07 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Sat, 07 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/telegram-phishing-campaign-re-emerges-abusing-authorization-prompts/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>
