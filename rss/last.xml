      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Fortinet Confirms Active Exploitation of FortiCloud SSO Bypass on Fully Patched FortiGate Firewalls</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>Fortinet has confirmed that a critical Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication bypass vulnerability affecting FortiCloud is being actively exploited in the wild. The attacks, linked to CVE-2025-59718 and CVE-2025-59719, are reportedly successful even against fully patched FortiGate firewalls. Attackers are exploiting the flaw by sending specially crafted SAML messages to bypass authentication. Once inside, they are creating persistent administrative accounts, enabling VPN access, and exfiltrating firewall configurations. This allows for long-term persistence and deep network compromise.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> New 'Osiris' Ransomware Borrows TTPs from Medusa and Inc Gangs, Uses Signed Driver to Kill AV</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A new ransomware strain named Osiris is demonstrating a high level of sophistication by combining tactics from established ransomware groups like Medusa and Inc. The attackers use Rclone for data exfiltration to Wasabi cloud storage and deploy a version of Mimikatz named `kaz.exe`, both TTPs linked to the Inc group. More significantly, Osiris uses a custom-developed and signed malicious driver, 'Abyssworker' (aka Poortry), in a Bring-Your-Own-Vulnerable-Driver (BYOVD) attack to terminate security software. This driver and its loader, 'Stonestop,' have been previously associated with the Medusa ransomware gang. The use of these advanced, borrowed TTPs suggests Osiris is operated by experienced actors, possibly former affiliates of other groups.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Ransomware, Malware, Threat Actor</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 6 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> The new Osiris ransomware strain shows links to Medusa and Inc groups, using a custom-signed malicious driver (Poortry/Abyssworker) to disable security software in a sophisticated BYOVD attack.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> new-osiris-ransomware-linked-to-medusa-and-inc-gang-ttps</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Update Count:</strong> 1</p><p><strong>Update History:</strong> 1 update recorded</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/new-osiris-ransomware-linked-to-medusa-and-inc-gang-ttps/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> 'SilentVoice' Phishing Campaign Weaponizes AI Deepfake Audio to Bypass MFA</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A sophisticated social engineering campaign named 'SilentVoice' is successfully bypassing multi-factor authentication (MFA) by using AI-generated deepfake audio of corporate executives. According to researchers at Proofpoint, attackers clone an executive's voice from public audio samples and then use it in a vishing (voice phishing) call to a subordinate employee. The deepfake voice creates a sense of urgency, tricking the employee into entering their credentials on a fake site and then approving the subsequent MFA push notification sent to their device. This highly convincing technique circumvents the protection offered by many common MFA methods, leading to full account takeover. The campaign has already resulted in successful breaches and financial fraud, highlighting the emerging threat of AI-weaponized social engineering.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Phishing, Threat Actor, Cyberattack</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 6 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Learn about the 'SilentVoice' campaign, a sophisticated attack where criminals use AI-generated deepfake audio of executives to bypass MFA and gain access to corporate accounts.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> silentvoice-phishing-campaign-uses-ai-deepfakes-to-bypass-mfa</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/silentvoice-phishing-campaign-uses-ai-deepfakes-to-bypass-mfa/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> CISA Issues Directive Mandating Federal Agencies Prepare for Post-Quantum Cryptography</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-03, a landmark mandate requiring Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to prepare for the transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). The directive addresses the future threat posed by quantum computers capable of breaking current public-key encryption standards. Agencies are required to inventory all systems using public-key cryptography by September 2026 and submit a comprehensive migration roadmap by March 2027. The initiative prioritizes the protection of systems with long-term data confidentiality needs, which are vulnerable to 'harvest now, decrypt later' attacks. This directive establishes the foundational steps for a coordinated, government-wide migration to NIST-standardized PQC algorithms.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Informational</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Policy and Compliance, Regulatory, Threat Intelligence</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Advisory</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> CISA has issued Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-03, requiring U.S. federal agencies to begin the transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to counter future quantum threats.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> cisa-issues-directive-on-post-quantum-cryptography-readiness</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/cisa-issues-directive-on-post-quantum-cryptography-readiness/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Volt Typhoon Linked to Breach at U.S. Water Utility, Exfiltrating Operational Documents</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>The Chinese state-sponsored group Volt Typhoon has been attributed to a data breach at the Park County Water District in Colorado. According to a joint advisory from CISA, the FBI, and the NSA, the hackers exploited a known vulnerability in an internet-facing network appliance to gain initial access. Consistent with their known TTPs, Volt Typhoon then used 'living off the land' techniques, leveraging built-in network administration tools to blend in and evade detection. The attackers moved laterally within the IT network and exfiltrated sensitive operational documents, including engineering schematics and maintenance schedules. While officials stated that the operational technology (OT) network and water supply were not affected, the incident highlights the group's continued focus on reconnaissance against U.S. critical infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Threat Actor, Cyberattack, Industrial Control Systems</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Advisory</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 6 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> The Chinese APT group Volt Typhoon has been linked to a data breach at a U.S. water utility, where they exploited a vulnerability and used 'living off the land' techniques to steal operational data.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> volt-typhoon-linked-to-data-breach-at-us-water-utility</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/volt-typhoon-linked-to-data-breach-at-us-water-utility/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>
