      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> CISA Warns of Critical ICS Flaws in Fuji, Delta, and Radiometrics Systems</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has released five advisories detailing critical vulnerabilities in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) from Fuji Electric, Survision, Delta Electronics, Radiometrics, and IDIS. The flaws, which include buffer overflows and authentication bypasses with CVSS scores up to 10.0, could allow remote code execution and severe disruption of critical infrastructure in sectors like manufacturing, energy, and aviation. CISA is urging immediate review and mitigation, as successful exploitation could lead to loss of control over industrial processes and, in some cases, create hazardous physical conditions.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Industrial Control Systems, Vulnerability, Patch Management</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> CISA has issued five advisories detailing critical vulnerabilities in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) from Fuji Electric, Survision, Delta, Radiometrics, and IDIS, posing risks of RCE and operational disruption.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> cisa-exposes-critical-flaws-in-industrial-control-systems</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Wed, 05 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Wed, 05 Nov 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Wed, 05 Nov 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/cisa-exposes-critical-flaws-in-industrial-control-systems/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

According to research from Acronis, the group has upgraded its malware to use a 'bring your own vulnerable driver' (BYOVD) technique to disable security software, using drivers like `truesight.sys`. The group has also been linked to the notorious financially motivated threat actor Scattered Spider, expanding its reach and sophistication. DragonForce has already listed over 200 victims on its leak site, targeting industries like retail, airlines, and MSPs.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Ransomware, Threat Actor, Malware</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> The DragonForce ransomware group, using leaked Conti source code, has rebranded as a 'cartel,' using BYOVD techniques to disable security software and collaborating with Scattered Spider.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> dragonforce-cartel-emerges-from-conti-with-upgraded-ransomware</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Wed, 05 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Wed, 05 Nov 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Wed, 05 Nov 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/dragonforce-cartel-emerges-from-conti-with-upgraded-ransomware/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Identity is the New Perimeter: Stolen Credentials and Over-Privileged Accounts Drive Cloud Breaches</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A consensus is forming across the cybersecurity industry: identity is the new security perimeter in the cloud. New reports from ReliaQuest and Amazon Web Services (AWS) reveal that identity-based attacks are the leading driver of cloud security incidents. Key findings show that compromised credentials caused 20% of breaches, while a staggering 99% of cloud identities are 'over-privileged,' possessing excessive permissions. Experts are urging a strategic shift away from network-centric security and towards a 'zero standing privileges' model, where access is granted on a temporary, as-needed basis to mitigate this massive attack surface.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Informational</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Cloud Security, Security Operations, Policy and Compliance</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Security reports reveal that identity-based attacks, fueled by stolen credentials and over-privileged cloud identities, are the leading cause of cloud security incidents, urging a move to zero standing privileges.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> identity-is-the-new-perimeter-cloud-attacks-driven-by-stolen-credentials</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Wed, 05 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Wed, 05 Nov 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Wed, 05 Nov 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/identity-is-the-new-perimeter-cloud-attacks-driven-by-stolen-credentials/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

The individuals, who worked in incident response and ransomware negotiation, allegedly used their specialized knowledge to extort at least five U.S. companies between May and November 2023. The attacks targeted organizations across multiple sectors, including healthcare and manufacturing, with one victim paying over $1.2 million in ransom. This case highlights the grave risks posed by malicious insiders within the cybersecurity industry itself.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Ransomware, Threat Actor, Data Breach</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Federal prosecutors charge two cybersecurity professionals, Ryan Clifford Goldberg and Kevin Tyler Martin, for deploying ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware against U.S. companies.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> cybersecurity-professionals-indicted-for-blackcat-ransomware-attacks</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Tue, 04 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Tue, 04 Nov 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Tue, 04 Nov 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/cybersecurity-professionals-indicted-for-blackcat-ransomware-attacks/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

Instead of a traditional Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model, DragonForce operates with a 'cartel-like' structure, providing affiliates with a builder to create their own branded ransomware variants. This approach facilitates the rapid proliferation of new threats, with groups like 'Devman' already seen deploying malware created with the DragonForce builder.

The report cites a dual crisis: a federal government shutdown that furloughs key cybersecurity personnel, and the lapse of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> US Cyber Threat Sharing Law 'CISA 2015' Expires, Creating Potential Intelligence Gap</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA 2015), a foundational U.S. law that provided liability protections to encourage private companies to share cyber threat data with the government, expired on October 1, 2025. Amidst a government shutdown and a block by Senator Rand Paul, lawmakers failed to reauthorize the act. Security and legal experts warn this could have a chilling effect on threat intelligence sharing, with one law firm predicting a potential 80% drop. The lapse creates uncertainty and could hinder national cybersecurity efforts. In response, new legislation, the PACT Act, has been introduced to retroactively restore and extend the protections, but its future is uncertain.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Policy and Compliance, Regulatory, Threat Intelligence</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> CISA 2015, Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, PACT Act, threat intelligence sharing, cybersecurity policy, US law, liability protection</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA 2015) has expired, removing key liability protections and sparking fears of a dramatic drop in public-private cyber threat intelligence sharing.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> key-us-cyber-information-sharing-law-expires-sparking-concerns</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Fri, 10 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Fri, 10 Oct 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Tue, 04 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Update Count:</strong> 1</p><p><strong>Update History:</strong> 1 update recorded</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/key-us-cyber-information-sharing-law-expires-sparking-concerns/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>
