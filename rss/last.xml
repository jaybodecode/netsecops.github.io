      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Critical RCE Flaw in WSUS Allows Unauthenticated SYSTEM Takeover</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, CVE-2025-59287, with a CVSS score of 9.8, has been discovered in Microsoft's Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). The flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker on the same network to gain SYSTEM-level privileges on a vulnerable server by sending a maliciously crafted cookie. The vulnerability stems from an unsafe deserialization process. While not yet exploited in the wild, Microsoft rates exploitation as "more likely." Given that compromising WSUS could enable an attacker to distribute malicious updates across an entire enterprise, immediate patching is strongly advised.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Vulnerability, Patch Management, Supply Chain Attack</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Advisory</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A critical remote code execution vulnerability, CVE-2025-59287 (CVSS 9.8), in Microsoft WSUS allows unauthenticated attackers to gain SYSTEM privileges.
