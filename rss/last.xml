      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> ShinyHunters Breaches Harvard, Exposing Sensitive Alumni and Donor Data via Vishing</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>The notorious cybercriminal group ShinyHunters has claimed responsibility for a significant data breach at Harvard University's Alumni Affairs and Development (AAD) department. The attack resulted in the exfiltration of approximately 115,000 sensitive records containing personal and financial details of the university's donors. Security analysts believe the breach was executed via a sophisticated voice-phishing (vishing) campaign, where attackers impersonated IT support to trick an employee into providing credentials and MFA tokens on a malicious single sign-on (SSO) portal. This incident highlights the growing threat of identity-based social engineering attacks against high-profile institutions.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Data Breach, Threat Actor, Phishing</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Details of the Harvard University data breach by the ShinyHunters group, which exposed 115,000 sensitive donor records through a suspected voice-phishing (vishing) campaign.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> shinyhunters-breaches-harvard-university-exposing-donor-data-via-vishing</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Thu, 05 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/shinyhunters-breaches-harvard-university-exposing-donor-data-via-vishing/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Black Basta Ransomware Evolves, Bundles Evasion Tool to Disable Security Software</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>The Black Basta ransomware group, also tracked as Cardinal, has significantly enhanced its attack methodology by embedding a defense evasion tool directly into its ransomware payload. This new variant utilizes a 'bring-your-own-vulnerable-driver' (BYOVD) technique, bundling a legitimate but vulnerable NsecSoft NSecKrnl driver to elevate privileges and terminate endpoint security processes. This self-contained approach streamlines the attack chain, making it more efficient and harder to detect compared to previous methods where evasion tools were deployed separately. The development signals a potential resurgence in activity from this major ransomware player.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Ransomware, Malware, Threat Actor</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Analysis of the Black Basta ransomware group's new tactic of embedding a 'bring-your-own-vulnerable-driver' (BYOVD) component to disable endpoint security software.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> black-basta-ransomware-evolves-with-embedded-byovd-evasion</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Thu, 05 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/black-basta-ransomware-evolves-with-embedded-byovd-evasion/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> 'Shadow Campaign' Hacks Governments in 37 Countries, China-Linked Group Suspected</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>Security researchers have uncovered a massive, long-running cyber-espionage operation dubbed 'Shadow Campaign.' The campaign is attributed to a suspected Chinese nation-state group, TGR-STA-1030, and has successfully compromised at least 70 government and critical infrastructure organizations in 37 countries. The group's reconnaissance activities have been even broader, targeting government infrastructure in 155 countries. Targets include high-value entities like national law enforcement, border control, finance ministries, and telecommunications companies. The operational footprint, including tools and timezone activity (GMT+8), strongly points towards a China-based actor.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Threat Actor, Cyberattack, Industrial Control Systems</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A massive cyber-espionage operation, 'Shadow Campaign,' attributed to a suspected Chinese APT group (TGR-STA-1030), has compromised at least 70 government and critical infrastructure organizations in 37 countries.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> shadow-campaign-espionage-activity-uncovered-china-suspected</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Thu, 05 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/shadow-campaign-espionage-activity-uncovered-china-suspected/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Futile Ransom: Nitrogen Ransomware Contains Fatal Coding Error, Decryption Impossible</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>In a case of profound operational failure, security researchers have discovered a fatal coding error in the Nitrogen ransomware group's malware that targets VMware ESXi systems. The flaw, found in the encryption routine, causes the malware to use the wrong public key during the encryption process. As a result, the decryptor provided by the gang after a ransom is paid is mathematically incapable of reversing the encryption. This means that any victim who pays the ransom for their encrypted ESXi virtual machines has zero chance of recovering their data, reinforcing law enforcement advice to not pay ransoms.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Ransomware, Malware</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 4 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A fatal coding error in the Nitrogen ransomware group's ESXi encryptor makes it impossible for the attackers to decrypt victim files, meaning any ransom paid is wasted.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> nitrogen-ransomware-esxi-encryptor-contains-fatal-coding-error</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Thu, 05 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/nitrogen-ransomware-esxi-encryptor-contains-fatal-coding-error/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> UK Advances New Bill to Regulate Managed Service Providers (MSPs)</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>The United Kingdom government is advancing a new Cyber Security and Resilience Bill aimed at strengthening the nation's digital supply chain. A key provision of the bill is to bring Managed Service Providers (MSPs) under direct regulatory oversight for the first time. Citing the systemic risk demonstrated by attacks like the one on Synnovis that impacted the NHS, the legislation will impose security duties on MSPs similar to those already applied to essential services. The goal is to establish a higher baseline of security across the thousands of organizations that rely on MSPs for their IT and security operations.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Informational</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Policy and Compliance, Regulatory, Supply Chain Attack</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Analysis</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> The UK's proposed Cyber Security and Resilience Bill aims to bring Managed Service Providers (MSPs) under direct regulatory control to improve national supply-chain security.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> uk-proposes-cyber-security-and-resilience-bill-to-regulate-msps</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Sat, 24 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Sat, 24 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Thu, 05 Feb 2026 12:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Update Count:</strong> 1</p><p><strong>Update History:</strong> 1 update recorded</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/uk-proposes-cyber-security-and-resilience-bill-to-regulate-msps/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>
