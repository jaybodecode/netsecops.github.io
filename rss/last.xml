      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Financial Sector Cyberattacks Doubled in 2025, Fueled by Geopolitical Hacktivism</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A new report from Check Point Software reveals a dramatic escalation in cyber threats targeting the global financial sector, with incidents more than doubling in 2025. The primary driver was a 105% increase in Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, which were largely motivated by geopolitically-driven hacktivism rather than direct financial gain. Hacktivist campaigns aimed to disrupt banking portals and payment systems in countries involved in geopolitical conflicts, including Israel, the U.S., and Ukraine. The report also highlights a 73% jump in data breaches and the persistent threat of multi-extortion ransomware, indicating a complex and evolving threat landscape for financial institutions.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Cyberattack, Threat Intelligence, Ransomware</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Report</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A Check Point report finds that cyberattacks on the financial sector doubled in 2025, driven by a 105% increase in DDoS attacks from hacktivist groups with geopolitical motives.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> financial-sector-cyberattacks-doubled-in-2025-fueled-by-hacktivism</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Fri, 06 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Fri, 06 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/financial-sector-cyberattacks-doubled-in-2025-fueled-by-hacktivism/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> CISA Confirms Ransomware Actively Exploits VMware ESXi Sandbox Escape Flaw</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>CISA has officially updated its KEV catalog to confirm that a high-severity sandbox escape vulnerability in VMware ESXi, CVE-2025-22225, is being actively exploited in ransomware attacks. The flaw, patched in March 2025, allows an attacker with local administrative privileges on a virtual machine to escape the sandbox and gain code execution on the underlying hypervisor. Research suggests the flaw is likely chained with two others (CVE-2025-22224 and CVE-2025-22226) and that an exploit toolkit may have existed a full year before the patch was released. CISA's confirmation underscores the urgent need for organizations to ensure their VMware environments are fully patched against these critical vulnerabilities.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Vulnerability, Ransomware, Patch Management</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Advisory</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 6 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> CISA confirms that a high-severity VMware ESXi vulnerability, CVE-2025-22225, is being actively exploited in ransomware campaigns, urging organizations to apply patches from March 2025.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> cisa-confirms-vmware-esxi-flaw-cve-2025-22225-exploited-in-ransomware-attacks</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Fri, 06 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Fri, 06 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/cisa-confirms-vmware-esxi-flaw-cve-2025-22225-exploited-in-ransomware-attacks/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

Currently in a developing state, the malware encrypts files and appends a '.milkyway' extension. It employs aggressive extortion tactics via a full-screen ransom note, threatening not only to leak or sell stolen data but also to report victims to tax authorities and law enforcement if the ransom is not paid. The operators also threaten to contact the victim's clients and partners. Experts warn that Milkyway could evolve into a more sophisticated threat, potentially adopting a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model, which would significantly broaden its impact.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Ransomware, Malware, Threat Intelligence</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Researchers have identified a new ransomware strain called 'Milkyway' that uses aggressive extortion tactics, including threats to report victims to authorities, and may evolve into a RaaS platform.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> new-milkyway-ransomware-strain-emerges-with-aggressive-extortion-tactics</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Fri, 06 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Fri, 06 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/new-milkyway-ransomware-strain-emerges-with-aggressive-extortion-tactics/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Stealthy 'Pulsar RAT' Campaign Uses Living-off-the-Land and In-Memory Execution</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A highly covert malware campaign is distributing a new modular backdoor and information stealer named 'Pulsar RAT'. The malware is notable for its extensive use of 'living-off-the-land' (LotL) techniques to evade detection. The infection chain uses a batch file to establish persistence via a Run registry key, then uses PowerShell to inject shellcode directly into the memory of legitimate processes like 'explorer.exe'.

This new variant utilizes a 'bring-your-own-vulnerable-driver' (BYOVD) technique, bundling a legitimate but vulnerable NsecSoft NSecKrnl driver to elevate privileges and terminate endpoint security processes. This self-contained approach streamlines the attack chain, making it more efficient and harder to detect compared to previous methods where evasion tools were deployed separately.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> 'Shadow Campaign' Hacks Governments in 37 Countries, China-Linked Group Suspected</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>Security researchers have uncovered a massive, long-running cyber-espionage operation dubbed 'Shadow Campaign.' The campaign is attributed to a suspected Chinese nation-state group, TGR-STA-1030, and has successfully compromised at least 70 government and critical infrastructure organizations in 37 countries. The group's reconnaissance activities have been even broader, targeting government infrastructure in 155 countries. Targets include high-value entities like national law enforcement, border control, finance ministries, and telecommunications companies. The operational footprint, including tools and timezone activity (GMT+8), strongly points towards a China-based actor.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Threat Actor, Cyberattack, Industrial Control Systems</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A massive cyber-espionage operation, 'Shadow Campaign,' attributed to a suspected Chinese APT group (TGR-STA-1030), has compromised at least 70 government and critical infrastructure organizations in 37 countries.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> shadow-campaign-espionage-activity-uncovered-china-suspected</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Thu, 05 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/shadow-campaign-espionage-activity-uncovered-china-suspected/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Futile Ransom: Nitrogen Ransomware Contains Fatal Coding Error, Decryption Impossible</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>In a case of profound operational failure, security researchers have discovered a fatal coding error in the Nitrogen ransomware group's malware that targets VMware ESXi systems. The flaw, found in the encryption routine, causes the malware to use the wrong public key during the encryption process. As a result, the decryptor provided by the gang after a ransom is paid is mathematically incapable of reversing the encryption. This means that any victim who pays the ransom for their encrypted ESXi virtual machines has zero chance of recovering their data, reinforcing law enforcement advice to not pay ransoms.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Ransomware, Malware</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 4 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A fatal coding error in the Nitrogen ransomware group's ESXi encryptor makes it impossible for the attackers to decrypt victim files, meaning any ransom paid is wasted.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> nitrogen-ransomware-esxi-encryptor-contains-fatal-coding-error</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Thu, 05 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/nitrogen-ransomware-esxi-encryptor-contains-fatal-coding-error/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

A key provision of the bill is to bring Managed Service Providers (MSPs) under direct regulatory oversight for the first time. Citing the systemic risk demonstrated by attacks like the one on Synnovis that impacted the NHS, the legislation will impose security duties on MSPs similar to those already applied to essential services. The goal is to establish a higher baseline of security across the thousands of organizations that rely on MSPs for their IT and security operations.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Informational</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Policy and Compliance, Regulatory, Supply Chain Attack</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Analysis</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> The UK's proposed Cyber Security and Resilience Bill aims to bring Managed Service Providers (MSPs) under direct regulatory control to improve national supply-chain security.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> uk-proposes-cyber-security-and-resilience-bill-to-regulate-msps</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Sat, 24 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Sat, 24 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Thu, 05 Feb 2026 12:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Update Count:</strong> 1</p><p><strong>Update History:</strong> 1 update recorded</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/uk-proposes-cyber-security-and-resilience-bill-to-regulate-msps/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>
