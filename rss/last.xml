      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Report: Ransomware Attacks Soared 52%, Supply Chain Attacks Nearly Doubled in 2025</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A new report from Cyble analyzing the 2025 cyber threat landscape reveals a record-breaking year for both ransomware and supply chain attacks. Ransomware incidents surged by 52%, with 6,604 attacks documented, while supply chain attacks saw a massive 93% increase to 297 events. The report highlights a dangerous convergence of these threats, with ransomware groups now perpetrating over half of all supply chain attacks by compromising a single software vendor to deploy ransomware to all its customers. The Qilin ransomware group was the most active player for the year, underscoring the persistent and evolving nature of these high-impact threats heading into 2026.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Informational</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Ransomware, Supply Chain Attack, Threat Intelligence</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> ransomware statistics 2025, supply chain attack statistics, Cyble report, Qilin ransomware, LockBit, cyber threat landscape</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 6 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A 2025 threat landscape report from Cyble reveals record-breaking increases in cybercrime, with ransomware attacks up 52% and supply chain attacks up 93% year-over-year.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> ransomware-and-supply-chain-attacks-reached-record-levels-in-2025</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Mon, 19 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/ransomware-and-supply-chain-attacks-reached-record-levels-in-2025/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Warning: Malicious Chrome Extensions Hijack Workday, NetSuite Sessions to Bypass MFA</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>Security researchers have uncovered five malicious Google Chrome extensions that impersonate legitimate add-ons for popular enterprise SaaS applications like Workday and NetSuite. The extensions are designed to perform session hijacking by stealing active session cookies and tokens after a user logs in. This technique allows attackers to completely bypass security controls, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), and gain full, authenticated access to the user's account. The stolen sessions can be used to exfiltrate sensitive corporate data, such as financial records and employee PII, highlighting the significant threat posed by unvetted browser extensions in corporate environments.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Malware, Data Breach, Cloud Security</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> malicious chrome extensions, session hijacking, Workday security, NetSuite security, bypass MFA, enterprise security, browser security</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 6 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Five malicious Google Chrome extensions have been found hijacking user sessions for enterprise apps like Workday and NetSuite, allowing attackers to bypass MFA and steal data.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> malicious-chrome-extensions-caught-hijacking-enterprise-user-sessions</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Mon, 19 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/malicious-chrome-extensions-caught-hijacking-enterprise-user-sessions/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Healthcare Data Breaches Double, Fueled by 'Shadow AI' and Vendor Risk</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>The healthcare industry is facing a cybersecurity crisis, with a new report indicating that the number of data breaches doubled in the past year. The surge is being driven by two key factors: the unmanaged use of generative AI tools by staff, termed 'shadow AI,' and persistent, unmitigated risks from third-party vendors. This dangerous trend is exemplified by the McLaren data breach, where a ransomware attack compromised the sensitive health information of over 743,000 patients. The report highlights a lack of confidence within the sector to handle these evolving threats, urging organizations to gain visibility into AI usage and implement far more stringent vendor risk management programs.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Data Breach, Ransomware, Policy and Compliance</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> healthcare data breach, shadow AI, third-party vendor risk, McLaren data breach, healthcare cybersecurity, HIPAA, ransomware</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 7 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A new report shows healthcare data breaches have doubled, driven by risks from 'shadow AI' and third-party vendors, as exemplified by the massive McLaren patient data breach.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> healthcare-breaches-double-amid-shadow-ai-and-vendor-risk</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Mon, 19 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/healthcare-breaches-double-amid-shadow-ai-and-vendor-risk/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Ransomware Attacks Skyrocket 58% in 2025, Setting New Records</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>Multiple cybersecurity reports released in January 2026 confirm that 2025 was the most active year for ransomware on record. A report from GuidePoint Security's GRIT team documented a staggering 58% year-over-year increase in publicly claimed ransomware victims. December 2025 alone saw 814 attacks, the highest monthly total ever recorded. Despite law enforcement takedowns of major players like LockBit, the ransomware ecosystem proved resilient. Affiliates quickly migrated to other operations, with the Qilin and Akira ransomware groups emerging as the dominant forces, collectively responsible for a significant portion of all attacks. The United States remained the primary target, and the manufacturing sector was the most heavily impacted industry.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Ransomware, Threat Intelligence, Threat Actor</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Report</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 7 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Cybersecurity reports from GuidePoint and Symantec show 2025 was a record year for ransomware, with a 58% increase in attacks and the rise of new dominant groups like Qilin and Akira.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> threat-reports-detail-record-breaking-ransomware-activity-in-2025</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Update Count:</strong> 1</p><p><strong>Update History:</strong> 1 update recorded</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/threat-reports-detail-record-breaking-ransomware-activity-in-2025/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> 2025 in Review: Simple Errors, Not 0-Days, Caused Biggest Breaches</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A year-end analysis of 2025's major data breaches reveals a recurring theme: fundamental security failures, not sophisticated zero-day exploits, were the primary cause. The report, published on December 26, 2025, highlights cloud security misconfigurations and third-party supply chain attacks as the dominant root causes. High-profile incidents at McDonald's (default password '123456'), TalentHook (public Azure Blob storage), Harrods, and TransUnion (both breached via third-party vendors) serve as stark examples of how neglecting basic security hygiene leads to massive data exposure.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Informational</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Data Breach, Supply Chain Attack, Cloud Security</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Analysis</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A 2025 year-in-review report highlights that cloud misconfigurations and third-party supply chain attacks were the root cause of the year's most significant data breaches.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> 2025-data-breaches-driven-by-misconfigurations-and-supply-chain-attacks</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Fri, 26 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Fri, 26 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Mon, 19 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Update Count:</strong> 1</p><p><strong>Update History:</strong> 1 update recorded</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/2025-data-breaches-driven-by-misconfigurations-and-supply-chain-attacks/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>
