      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> SLSH Alliance Hits 100+ Firms in Sophisticated Okta SSO Voice Phishing Blitz</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A highly organized, human-led phishing campaign is targeting the Okta Single Sign-On (SSO) credentials of over 100 high-profile enterprises across technology, finance, and healthcare. The attack, attributed to the SLSH cybercrime alliance (linked to Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters), uses interactive voice phishing (vishing) to manipulate victims into approving multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompts. The attackers employ a live phishing panel to intercept credentials and MFA tokens in real-time, enabling them to bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access to corporate networks. The widespread campaign has prepared infrastructure to target major companies like Atlassian, Moderna, Zillow, and Halliburton, posing a significant identity-based threat.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Phishing, Threat Actor, Cyberattack</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 6 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Analysis of a large-scale, human-led phishing campaign by the SLSH cybercrime group targeting Okta SSO credentials at over 100 enterprises using voice phishing to bypass MFA.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> shinyhunters-linked-group-targets-100-plus-firms-in-okta-sso-phishing-campaign</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Fri, 30 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Fri, 30 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Fri, 30 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/shinyhunters-linked-group-targets-100-plus-firms-in-okta-sso-phishing-campaign/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Apple Boosts Privacy in iOS 26.3 with 'Limit Precise Location' Feature</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>Apple has introduced a new privacy feature called 'limit precise location' in its iOS 26.3 update. This setting is designed to give users more control over their data by reducing the precision of location information shared with cellular networks. While carriers still receive location data for operational purposes, the feature prevents them from obtaining a user's exact, fine-grained location, making it more difficult to track their precise movements. This update is part of a broader industry trend toward providing users with more granular privacy controls and addressing concerns about location tracking by mobile carriers.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Informational</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Mobile Security, Policy and Compliance</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 3 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Apple's iOS 26.3 update includes a new 'limit precise location' privacy setting, which reduces the precision of location data shared with cellular networks to enhance user privacy.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> apple-enhances-location-privacy-in-ios-26-3-update</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Fri, 30 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Fri, 30 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Fri, 30 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/apple-enhances-location-privacy-in-ios-26-3-update/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Open-Source Malware Skyrockets by 75%, Sonatype's 2026 Report Warns</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>Sonatype's 2026 'State of the Software Supply Chain' report reveals an alarming 75% increase in malicious open-source packages, with over 1.233 million identified. The report connects this surge to the rapid adoption of AI and automation in software development, which has accelerated open-source consumption to 9.8 trillion downloads across major registries. This increased velocity expands the attack surface, making it easier for attackers to inject malware into the software supply chain. The report also notes that 86% of traffic from Maven Central, a key Java repository, now comes from automated cloud services, amplifying the risk of widespread compromise from a single malicious package.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Informational</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Supply Chain Attack, Threat Intelligence, Malware</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Report</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Discover the findings of Sonatype's 2026 State of the Software Supply Chain report, which reveals a 75% increase in open-source malware, driven by AI and automation in software development.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> sonatype-2026-report-open-source-malware-surges-75-percent</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Thu, 29 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Thu, 29 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/sonatype-2026-report-open-source-malware-surges-75-percent/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Convergence of Identity and Data Security Creates New Attack Vectors, Netwrix Warns</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A new report from Netwrix warns that the next wave of cyber threats will arise from the convergence of identity and data security. As organizations increasingly rely on automated workflows to manage data access, attackers are shifting their focus from stealing individual credentials to exploiting misconfigured identity orchestration and automation. The report predicts that failures in identity automation will directly lead to data exposure. With the rise of agentic AI, which can autonomously perform actions, securing the identity of these non-human agents becomes paramount. Netwrix concludes that unified visibility across both identity management and data security is now essential to mitigate these emerging risks.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Informational</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Threat Intelligence, Policy and Compliance, Cloud Security</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Report</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A new report from Netwrix warns that attackers are shifting focus to exploit the convergence of identity and data security, targeting automation and orchestration workflows.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> SoundCloud Breach Exposes Private Emails of 29.8 Million Users</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A significant data breach at the music streaming service SoundCloud has resulted in the public release of a database containing the personal details of 29.8 million users. The data was leaked in January 2026 after the company reportedly refused to pay a ransom demand. The primary risk from this breach stems from the linking of users' private email addresses with their public profile metadata. This combination provides a rich source of data for attackers to launch targeted phishing, credential stuffing, and social engineering campaigns. The breach has been indexed by the notification service HaveIBeenPwned.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Data Breach, Threat Intelligence</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A massive data breach at SoundCloud has publicly exposed a database with the private email addresses and profile data of 29.8 million users.
