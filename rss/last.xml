The flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to achieve SYSTEM-level privileges, leading Microsoft to release an emergency out-of-band patch after its initial October fix proved insufficient. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, mandating federal agencies to patch by November 14, 2025. Security researchers have observed in-the-wild attacks leveraging unsafe deserialization in the WSUS `GetCookie()` endpoint, underscoring the urgency for all organizations to apply the update immediately.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Vulnerability, Patch Management, Cyberattack</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Advisory</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Urgent analysis of CVE-2025-59287, a critical RCE vulnerability in Microsoft WSUS being actively exploited.

The group has listed Xortec on its data leak site with a payment deadline of October 27, 2025. This attack raises significant supply chain concerns, as a compromise of a value-added distributor like Xortec could potentially lead to backdoored hardware or software being deployed in sensitive client environments.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Nations Sign Landmark UN Cybercrime Treaty Amidst Privacy and Rights Concerns</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>In a landmark event in Hanoi, Vietnam, 72 nations have signed the first-ever United Nations Convention against Cybercrime. The treaty aims to establish a global legal framework for international cooperation in fighting digital crime, including provisions for rapid cross-border evidence sharing. While hailed by the UN as a major step in multilateralism, the convention has drawn sharp criticism from over 160 technology firms, including Meta and Dell, and various civil society groups. Critics warn its broad language could be used to criminalize legitimate security research and enable governments to repress dissent under the guise of fighting cybercrime.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Informational</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Policy and Compliance, Regulatory</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Dozens of countries sign the first global UN Convention against Cybercrime in Hanoi.
