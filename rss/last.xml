      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Ransomware Evolves: Data Theft Now Favored Over Encryption in Extortion-Only Attacks</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>Security analysis reveals a fundamental shift in the ransomware business model, with threat actors increasingly favoring "extortion-only" attacks that forgo data encryption entirely. This evolved tactic focuses on silent, long-term data exfiltration followed by threats to leak the stolen information publicly. This approach is stealthier than traditional encryption and effectively bypasses backup-based recovery strategies, turning every attack into a data breach crisis. Groups like Cl0p and ShinyHunters have pioneered this model, which accounted for a significant portion of the 6,182 extortion incidents in 2025.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Informational</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Ransomware, Threat Intelligence, Data Breach</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Analysis</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A major trend in ransomware sees attackers shifting to "extortion-only" tactics, prioritizing silent data exfiltration and public leak threats over traditional data encryption.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> encryptionless-extortion-becomes-dominant-ransomware-tactic</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/encryptionless-extortion-becomes-dominant-ransomware-tactic/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> 'CrazyHunter' Ransomware Targets Taiwanese Hospitals with Advanced Tactics</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A sophisticated Go-based ransomware variant named CrazyHunter is escalating attacks, primarily targeting the healthcare sector in Taiwan with at least six confirmed victims. According to research from Trellix, CrazyHunter is a fork of the open-source 'Prince Ransomware' but incorporates significant enhancements. The attackers use weak Active Directory passwords for initial access, leverage the SharpGPOAbuse tool for rapid network-wide deployment, and employ Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) techniques to disable security software. The ransomware uses a hybrid ChaCha20 and ECIES encryption scheme and appends the `.Hunter` extension to files.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Ransomware, Threat Actor, Malware</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> The CrazyHunter ransomware, a sophisticated variant of Prince ransomware, is targeting Taiwanese healthcare organizations using advanced tactics like GPO abuse and BYOVD for defense evasion.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> crazyhunter-ransomware-escalates-attacks-on-taiwanese-healthcare</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/crazyhunter-ransomware-escalates-attacks-on-taiwanese-healthcare/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> GoBruteforcer Botnet Targets Linux Servers with Weak Passwords and AI-Generated Defaults</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A modular, Go-based botnet named GoBruteforcer is actively targeting Linux servers by brute-forcing weak passwords for exposed services like phpMyAdmin, MySQL, and FTP. According to Check Point Research, the campaign's success is fueled by two trends: the continued use of insecure legacy web stacks and the proliferation of insecure default configurations suggested by AI tools. The botnet turns compromised machines into scanners to find more victims. The financially motivated attackers also deploy tools to scan for and drain cryptocurrency wallets on compromised servers, with a focus on TRON and Binance Smart Chain.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Malware, Cyberattack, Cloud Security</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A Go-based botnet, GoBruteforcer, is actively targeting Linux servers by brute-forcing weak passwords on services like phpMyAdmin and MySQL, with a link to insecure, AI-generated default credentials.</p><p><strong>Article Slug:</strong> gobuteforcer-botnet-exploits-weak-passwords-in-linux-servers-fueled-by-ai-defaults</p><p><strong>Published Date:</strong> Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Created Date:</strong> Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</p><p><a href="https://cyber.netsecops.io/articles/gobuteforcer-botnet-exploits-weak-passwords-in-linux-servers-fueled-by-ai-defaults/">Read Full Article →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> French Immigration Agency Data Leaked via Third-Party Breach</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>France's Office for Immigration and Integration (OFII) has confirmed a data breach originating from a compromised third-party service provider. In early January 2026, a hacker claimed to be selling a database of up to 2.1 million records of foreign residents on BreachForums, posting samples that included names, contact details, and nationalities. OFII clarified that its own systems were not breached, but that the attack targeted a private training provider responsible for mandatory integration courses. The incident highlights the significant risks of supply chain attacks for government agencies and could lead to GDPR penalties for OFII as the data controller.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Data Breach, Supply Chain Attack, Regulatory</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> NewsArticle</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> France's immigration agency, OFII, confirms a data breach via a third-party contractor, leading to the leak of foreign residents' personal data.
