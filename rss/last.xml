      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> LANDFALL Spyware Uses Samsung Zero-Day for Zero-Click Attacks in Middle East</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>A sophisticated commercial-grade Android spyware known as LANDFALL has been identified in targeted cyber-espionage campaigns across the Middle East. The attackers exploited a critical zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2025-21042, in Samsung Galaxy devices to achieve remote code execution without user interaction. The flaw, an out-of-bounds write in an image processing library, was triggered by sending a malicious DNG image file. The campaign was active for months before Samsung issued a patch in April 2025, affecting users in Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Morocco. Once installed, LANDFALL acts as a comprehensive surveillance tool, capable of exfiltrating a wide array of data, including microphone recordings, location data, photos, and communications.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Vulnerability, Malware, Threat Actor</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Advisory</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> LANDFALL spyware, CVE-2025-21042, Samsung zero-day, Android security, zero-click exploit, Middle East cyber attack, mobile spyware, Unit 42, libimagecodec.quram.so</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 6 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Learn about the LANDFALL spyware campaign that used a critical Samsung zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2025-21042, to conduct zero-click attacks against targets in the Middle East.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Cl0p Gang Exploits Oracle EBS Zero-Day in Massive Data Theft Spree</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>The Cl0p ransomware syndicate, also known as Graceful Spider, is actively exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2025-61882, in Oracle's E-Business Suite (EBS). The flaw, which has a CVSS score of 9.8, allows for unauthenticated remote code execution and has been used to steal data from numerous organizations since at least August 2025. The attackers exfiltrated data for weeks before sending extortion demands in late September. In response, Oracle released an emergency patch on October 4, 2025, and CISA has added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, mandating a patch deadline for federal agencies.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Vulnerability, Ransomware, Data Breach</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Advisory</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Detailed analysis of the Cl0p ransomware campaign exploiting the critical Oracle E-Business Suite zero-day vulnerability CVE-2025-61882.

The company confirmed that an unauthorized party accessed and exfiltrated firewall configuration backups for **all** customers of its MySonicWall cloud backup service, a stark revision from the initial estimate of less than 5%. The stolen `.EXP` files contain complete firewall configurations, including security rules and encrypted credentials. While the credentials remain encrypted, security experts warn that possession of these files significantly lowers the bar for future targeted attacks. SonicWall, assisted by **[Mandiant](https://www.mandiant.com/)**, is urging all affected customers to reset passwords and follow detailed mitigation guidance.</p><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p><p><strong>Categories:</strong> Data Breach, Supply Chain Attack, Cloud Security</p><p><strong>Article Type:</strong> Advisory</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> SonicWall data breach, MySonicWall, firewall configuration, cloud backup breach, Mandiant, cybersecurity incident, network security</p><p><strong>Reading Time:</strong> 5 minutes</p><p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> SonicWall confirms a massive data breach impacting all users of its MySonicWall cloud backup service.
