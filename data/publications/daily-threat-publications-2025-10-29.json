  "summary": "This cybersecurity brief for October 29, 2025, covers a series of critical threats, led by an urgent CISA directive to patch an actively exploited, wormable RCE vulnerability in Windows Server Update Services (CVE-2025-59287). The threat landscape is further defined by major zero-day attacks, with the FIN11/Clop ransomware group targeting Oracle EBS systems at industrial giants, and the 'Mem3nt0 mori' APT exploiting a Chrome zero-day. New malware strains have also emerged, including 'Airstalk' in a suspected nation-state supply chain attack and 'Herodotus', an Android trojan that mimics human behavior. Additionally, a report highlights the destructive impact of the 'Scattered Spider' group and a massive surge in AI-powered vishing attacks.",

      "severity": "high",
      "excerpt": "The personal data of 5.7 million Qantas Airways customers has been published on the dark web by a group calling itself 'Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters'. The leak, which occurred after a ransom deadline passed on October 11, 2025, is part of a broader supply chain attack that compromised a third-party Salesforce system used by one of the airline's offshore call centers. The compromised data includes names, emails, frequent flyer information, and for some, addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth. The attack vector involved social engineering, with hackers impersonating Salesforce employees to gain access. Qantas confirmed the breach, stating it is one of 39 companies affected by the campaign and that financial data and passwords were not compromised. The incident has prompted warnings of secondary phishing attacks and a class-action complaint.",

      "updateContent": "A new KnowBe4 report details the escalating threat from 'Scattered Spider' (UNC3944), the group involved in the Qantas breach. Their social engineering, vishing (up 449%), MFA fatigue, and deepfake audio tactics have led to hundreds of millions in losses for UK retailers like M&S and Harrods. This confirms the Qantas incident as part of a larger, highly impactful campaign, providing critical new context on the group's evolving methods and broader victim scope. Updated mitigation strategies emphasize phishing-resistant MFA and enhanced help desk verification."
