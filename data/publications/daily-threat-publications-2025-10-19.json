      "excerpt": "A coordinated international law enforcement operation codenamed \"SIMCARTEL\" has dismantled a massive Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform operating out of Latvia. The operation, involving authorities from Austria, Estonia, and Finland with support from Europol, resulted in seven arrests and the seizure of a vast infrastructure that enabled millions of euros in financial fraud. The network provided criminals with access to over 40,000 active SIM cards via SIM box devices, which were used to create approximately 49 million fraudulent online accounts, facilitating crimes like phishing, smishing, and investment fraud across Europe.",

The group's evolving tactics and widening geographic scope indicate an increased threat to government and commercial entities across Asia.",
