      "updateContent": "New intelligence attributes the active exploitation of CVE-2025-61932 to the China-linked 'Bronze Butler' (Tick) APT group. Researchers confirm the group exploited this vulnerability as a zero-day, initiating attacks in mid-2025, months before a patch was available. The APT deployed an updated 'Gokcpdoor' backdoor for data theft and remote control, utilizing tools like 'goddi' for credential dumping and 7-Zip for archiving. This attribution to a sophisticated nation-state actor significantly elevates the threat level and highlights the advanced nature of the ongoing campaign."
