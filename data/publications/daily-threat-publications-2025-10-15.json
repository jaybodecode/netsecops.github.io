      "severity": "high",
      "excerpt": "After a two-month hiatus following law enforcement disruption, the prolific LockBit ransomware group has returned, announcing the release of LockBit 5.0. This new version of the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) malware incorporates significant technical upgrades designed to evade detection and analysis. According to researchers, a key new feature is the ability to patch Event Tracing for Windows (ETW), a technique that blinds security monitoring tools by altering in-memory logging. The upgraded malware is designed for cross-platform attacks, targeting Windows, Linux, and VMware ESXi environments, signaling LockBit's intent to reclaim its dominant position in the cybercrime ecosystem.",

      "excerpt": "Despite a slight decrease in overall weekly cyber attacks, ransomware activity has surged by 46%, according to a new report from Check Point Research. This indicates a strategic shift by threat actors towards more focused and impactful ransomware campaigns. The construction, business services, and industrial manufacturing sectors have been the most victimized, bearing the brunt of this new wave. The report identifies the Qilin ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group as one of the most prominent actors, responsible for 14.1% of publicly disclosed victims. The findings highlight an urgent need for organizations, especially in the industrial and business services sectors, to bolster their defenses against an increasingly targeted ransomware threat.",
