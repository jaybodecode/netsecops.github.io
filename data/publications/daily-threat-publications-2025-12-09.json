  "summary": "This cybersecurity brief for December 9, 2025, covers a critical unauthenticated RCE vulnerability, dubbed \"React2Shell\" (CVE-2025-55182), affecting React Server Components and now under active exploitation by multiple threat actors, including state-sponsored groups. Other major developments include the DeadLock ransomware using a novel \"Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver\" technique to disable EDRs, the evolution of IAB Storm-0249's tactics, and a new \"code-to-cloud\" attack vector abusing leaked GitHub Personal Access Tokens. The brief details these threats, provides technical analysis, and offers actionable mitigation strategies for defenders.",

      "excerpt": "Marquis Software Solutions, a U.S.-based financial software provider, has suffered a major data breach, compromising the sensitive information of over 400,000 customers across 74 client banks and credit unions. This significant supply chain attack is suspected to be the work of the Akira ransomware gang. According to investigators, the threat actors likely gained initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities in SonicWall firewall devices on Marquis's network. This incident highlights the cascading risk in the financial sector, where a compromise at a single software vendor can have widespread consequences for numerous downstream institutions and their customers.",

      "excerpt": "A new DeadLock ransomware campaign is leveraging a novel \"Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver\" (BYOVD) loader to exploit a vulnerability (CVE-2024-51324) in a legitimate Baidu Antivirus driver, `BdApiUtil.sys`. This technique allows the threat actors to terminate any process, including endpoint detection and response (EDR) and antivirus solutions, from the kernel level. By blinding security tools, the attackers can deploy the ransomware unimpeded. The attack chain, analyzed by Cisco Talos, also involves PowerShell scripts to disable Windows Defender and delete volume shadow copies, severely hindering detection and recovery efforts.",

      "excerpt": "Security researchers at Wiz have detailed an emerging \"code-to-cloud\" attack vector where threat actors leverage compromised GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs) to pivot from code repositories directly into production cloud environments. By abusing the trust between GitHub and connected Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), attackers with even basic read permissions can discover secret names, then use write permissions to execute malicious GitHub Actions that exfiltrate CSP credentials. The attack is particularly stealthy as API calls to search for secret names are not logged by GitHub Enterprise, creating a major visibility gap for defenders.",

According to research from Cydome, the campaign specifically targets the maritime logistics sector, where these DVRs are common. Broadside is more advanced than typical Mirai variants, using stealthier techniques and a custom C2 protocol. Crucially, its goals extend beyond DDoS to include credential harvesting and lateral movement, turning compromised DVRs into strategic footholds on vessel networks.",

Attackers impersonate IT support staff on Microsoft Teams, convincing users to initiate a Windows Quick Assist session. Once they have remote access, the attackers direct the user to a malicious site to download a loader. This loader then fetches an encrypted payload and executes it directly in memory using .NET reflection, a fileless technique designed to evade traditional antivirus and endpoint detection solutions. The campaign highlights the increasing trend of blending social engineering with the abuse of legitimate software.",
