  "summary": "This cybersecurity brief for December 25, 2025, covers a volatile period marked by significant industry consolidation and escalating cyber threats. The lead story is ServiceNow's landmark $7.75 billion acquisition of Armis, signaling a major push towards AI-driven security platforms. In tandem, pro-Russian hacktivists launched a disruptive DDoS attack against France's postal service, crippling operations before Christmas. Regulatory actions saw the SEC charge seven firms in a $14 million AI-themed crypto scam that used deepfakes. Other major incidents include a supply chain breach at Nissan exposing 21,000 customers via a compromised Red Hat server, and a significant healthcare data breach originating from subcontractor TriZetto with a year-long dwell time. Reports also highlight a surge in AI-powered phishing targeting holiday shoppers and ICS systems in East Asia.",

      "severity": "informational",
      "excerpt": "Palo Alto Networks' 2025 'State of Cloud Security Report' reveals that the rapid adoption of AI is creating an unprecedented expansion of the cloud attack surface. The study, surveying 2,800 security leaders, found that 99% of organizations have had their AI systems attacked in the last year. The use of generative AI in coding is producing insecure code faster than security teams can remediate it, creating a significant risk gap. API attacks have surged by 41% year-over-year, and lenient identity and access management (IAM) remains a top vulnerability. The report calls for a unified, platform-based approach to cloud security to counter AI-weaponized threats.",

The region jumped to third place globally for the percentage of ICS computers where malicious objects were blocked. The most alarming trend was a surge in malicious scripts and phishing pages, which became the top threat category, with attack rates 1.4 times higher than the global average. This spike is primarily attributed to attacks targeting the engineering and ICS integrator sector in Mainland China, where malware was found hidden in customized P2P client applications.",
