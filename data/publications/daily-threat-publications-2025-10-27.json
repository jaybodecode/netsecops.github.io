      "severity": "high",
      "excerpt": "Cybersecurity researchers report a staggering 50% increase in ransomware attacks in 2025, with over 5,000 incidents claimed on dark web leak sites by late October. This surge occurs amidst a significant realignment in the ransomware ecosystem, with formerly dominant groups fading while new and resurgent actors like Qilin take their place. The Qilin group has been particularly prolific, leading in victim counts for most of the past six months. The United States remains the most targeted nation, and the industrial sector is the most heavily impacted industry. PowerShell has become the primary tool for attackers, used in nearly 78% of observed campaigns.",

      "updateContent": "The Qilin ransomware group's victim count has dramatically increased to 701 by late October, up from 441, making it the most prolific group of 2025. This surge is attributed to absorbing affiliates from the defunct RansomHub operation. High-profile attacks include Synnovis ($44M cost), Shamir Medical Center (8TB data theft), and disruptions to French high schools, highlighting increased financial and operational damages across critical sectors like healthcare and manufacturing. The group's expanded reach and impact signify a heightened threat landscape."

Researchers at LayerX Security found that this flaw can be used to invisibly inject malicious instructions into ChatGPT's persistent 'Memory' feature. These instructions survive across sessions and devices, and can be triggered by a user's normal prompts to execute malicious code, potentially leading to account takeover or malware deployment.",
