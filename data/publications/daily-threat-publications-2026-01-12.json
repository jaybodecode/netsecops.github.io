      "excerpt": "The G7 Cyber Expert Group (CEG), co-chaired by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Bank of England, has issued a public statement and roadmap advising the global financial sector to begin a coordinated transition to quantum-resilient technology. The guidance warns that advanced quantum computers will eventually be able to break the public-key cryptography that secures the world's financial transactions. The roadmap encourages financial institutions to start assessing their quantum risks and developing formal plans for migrating to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standards, such as those being developed by NIST, to counter 'harvest now, decrypt later' attacks.",

      "severity": "high",
      "excerpt": "A novel supply chain attack discovered by Endor Labs is targeting users of the n8n workflow automation platform. Attackers are publishing malicious packages to the npm registry, disguised as legitimate 'community nodes' for popular services. When an unsuspecting user installs one of these nodes and enters their credentials (e.g., OAuth tokens, API keys), the malicious code exfiltrates the entire credential store from the n8n instance to an attacker-controlled server. This gives the attackers access to all services connected to the victim's n8n workflows, such as Salesforce and Stripe, creating a significant risk of widespread data breaches and financial fraud.",

      "excerpt": "The World Economic Forum's (WEF) 'Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2026' report, produced with Accenture, reveals a major shift in the threat landscape: cyber-enabled fraud and phishing have now surpassed ransomware as the top concern for global business leaders. The report highlights that fraud has reached 'record highs,' with 77% of leaders reporting an increase. It also identifies Artificial Intelligence as the most consequential force shaping cybersecurity in 2026, with 94% of leaders agreeing it will be the biggest factor. AI is seen as a double-edged sword, accelerating both offensive capabilities and defensive solutions, while growing concerns about data leaks from generative AI persist.",

      "excerpt": "A modular Go-based botnet named GoBruteforcer is actively compromising internet-facing Linux servers by brute-forcing weak credentials for services like FTP, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. According to Check Point Research, the campaign's success is fueled by the widespread use of default or weak passwords, often found in AI-generated server deployment examples. Once compromised, servers are added to an IRC-controlled botnet and used to scan for more victims. The attackers have a clear financial motive, as they have been observed deploying tools on compromised hosts to scan for and drain TRON and Binance Smart Chain cryptocurrency wallets.",

      "excerpt": "A high-severity vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-64496, has been discovered in Open WebUI, a popular self-hosted interface for large language models (LLMs). The flaw, found by Cato Networks, allows a malicious AI server to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into a user's browser session. This can be exploited to steal authentication tokens and take over the user's account. If the compromised user has specific permissions enabled, the vulnerability can be escalated to achieve full remote code execution (RCE) on the host server. The issue affects Open WebUI versions 0.6.34 and older and was patched in version 0.6.35.",
