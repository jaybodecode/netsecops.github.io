      "severity": "medium",
      "excerpt": "The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA 2015), a foundational U.S. law that provided liability protections to encourage private companies to share cyber threat data with the government, expired on October 1, 2025. Amidst a government shutdown and a block by Senator Rand Paul, lawmakers failed to reauthorize the act. Security and legal experts warn this could have a chilling effect on threat intelligence sharing, with one law firm predicting a potential 80% drop. The lapse creates uncertainty and could hinder national cybersecurity efforts. In response, new legislation, the PACT Act, has been introduced to retroactively restore and extend the protections, but its future is uncertain.",

      "updateContent": "The U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security's 'Cyber Threat Snapshot' warns that national cyber defenses are severely hampered by the ongoing federal government shutdown and the continued lapse of CISA 2015. This dual crisis creates 'dangerous blind spots' amidst escalating threats from nation-state actors like China and Iran, with a 133% spike in Iranian attacks and a rise in AI-driven cyberattacks. The report emphasizes reduced situational awareness and increased risk to critical infrastructure, urging immediate action to restore funding and information-sharing legislation."

      "severity": "critical",
      "excerpt": "A critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, CVE-2025-11953, has been discovered in a popular React Native command-line tool, putting millions of developers at risk. The flaw, rated 9.8 on the CVSS scale, exists in the '@react-native-community/cli' NPM package and allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a developer's machine by sending a malicious request to the Metro development server. This could lead to source code theft, malware injection, or a full-blown supply chain attack. Meta has released a patch, and developers are strongly urged to update their dependencies.",

      "severity": "high",
      "excerpt": "A new ransomware operation named DragonForce has been identified by security researchers, notable for its use of leaked source code from the infamous Conti ransomware. Instead of a traditional Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model, DragonForce operates with a 'cartel-like' structure, providing affiliates with a builder to create their own branded ransomware variants. This approach facilitates the rapid proliferation of new threats, with groups like 'Devman' already seen deploying malware created with the DragonForce builder. The core malware retains Conti's technical features, including its encryption scheme and ability to spread via SMB.",

Hosted in Cyprus with support from the EU's cybersecurity agency, ENISA, the exercise brought together senior officials from all member states to role-play a significant cyber incident affecting critical sectors. The drill was the first to test the new EU Cyber Blueprint, which aims to clarify roles and streamline coordination between national authorities and the European Commission during a cross-border attack.",
