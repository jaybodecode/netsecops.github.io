  "headline": "China's Cyber War on Taiwan Intensifies; Critical Flaws in IoT and Enterprise Software Actively Exploited",
  "summary": "A cybersecurity report for January 4, 2026, reveals a significant escalation in state-sponsored cyberattacks, with a Taiwanese government report detailing over 2.6 million daily attacks from China in 2025. Concurrently, critical vulnerabilities are under active exploitation, including a memory disclosure flaw in MongoDB ('Mongobleed') added to CISA's KEV list, and a zero-day in Oracle E-Business Suite leveraged by the Clop group. The IoT landscape is also under fire, with critical remote hijacking flaws discovered in WHILL electric wheelchairs and Petlibro smart feeders, highlighting severe physical and privacy risks. Major data breaches continue to have fallout, with 700Credit exposing 5.6 million consumer records via API abuse and Cognizant facing lawsuits over its TriZetto healthcare data breach.",

      "severity": "high",
      "excerpt": "Korean Air announced on December 29, 2025, that it suffered a data breach affecting the personal information of approximately 30,000 employees. The breach was the result of a supply chain attack targeting KC&D Service, a former subsidiary. The incident is believed to be the work of the prolific Clop ransomware group (also known as TA505 or FIN11), which exploited a critical zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-61882) in Oracle E-Business Suite. This remote code execution flaw, with a CVSS score of 9.8, is part of a wider Clop campaign targeting the aviation industry's supply chain.",

      "updateContent": "New information confirms that the Clop extortion group has not only claimed responsibility but also leaked the stolen employee data from Korean Air. Crucially, the Oracle E-Business Suite zero-day vulnerability, central to this attack, was actively exploited by Clop for several months, beginning in August 2025, before a patch was available. This prolonged exploitation window allowed Clop to compromise numerous organizations globally, indicating a much wider impact of this campaign than initially reported. Clop's primary objective in this campaign is now understood to be data theft and extortion, rather than traditional ransomware deployment."

The vulnerability now has a confirmed CVSS score of 10.0, making it a critical, unpatched RCE flaw. This lack of vendor support means no official patch is available, significantly increasing the risk to affected organizations. Researchers at Pwn.ai, who publicly disclosed the flaw, also claim it was discovered using an AI agent. Due to the vendor's unresponsiveness, the primary remediation advice is now to isolate or replace affected devices, as patching is not an option."

The island faced an average of 2.63 million cyberattacks daily, a 6% increase from 2024 and double the rate of 2023. The attacks are described as a core component of Beijing's hybrid warfare strategy, targeting nine critical sectors including energy, healthcare, and government agencies. The NSB identified prominent threat groups like BlackTech, Flax Typhoon, and APT41 behind the campaigns, which utilized vulnerability exploitation, DDoS attacks, and supply chain intrusions. The energy sector saw an alarming 1,000% increase in attacks, underscoring a strategic effort to probe and potentially disrupt Taiwan's essential services.",

      "excerpt": "A serious improper access control vulnerability, CVE-2025-3653, has been found in the backend API for Petlibro's smart pet feeders. The flaw allows a remote attacker to take full control of any Petlibro device simply by sending its serial number to the API, with no authentication required. A successful attacker can alter feeding schedules, dispense food on command, and, on camera-equipped models, view the live video feed. Disclosed by VulnCheck, the vulnerability affects Petlibro Smart Pet Feeder Platform versions up to 1.7.31 and highlights the persistent failure of some IoT manufacturers to implement basic security controls, creating significant privacy and safety risks for consumers.",

The flaw is an improper path validation issue (path traversal) that can be triggered by a malicious remote server. An attacker can trick a vulnerable Wget2 client into writing a downloaded file to an arbitrary location on the filesystem. This could be exploited to overwrite critical system files, user configuration files (like .bashrc), or place malicious scripts in sensitive locations, potentially leading to data loss, denial of service, or remote code execution.",

This status indicates that while the identifier was reserved by a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA), it was ultimately not used for a public vulnerability disclosure. This can occur for several reasons, such as the finding being a duplicate of an existing CVE, the issue not meeting the criteria for a vulnerability, or the researcher withdrawing the submission. While rejected CVEs contain no technical details, their existence provides transparency into the administrative backend of the global vulnerability tracking system.",
