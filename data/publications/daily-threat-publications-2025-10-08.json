  "summary": "This cybersecurity brief for October 8, 2025, covers several critical incidents. A threat actor alliance named 'Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters' claims to have stolen data from over 40 Salesforce customers via social engineering, though Salesforce itself was not breached and refuses to pay the ransom. Concurrently, the Cl0p ransomware group is actively exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-61882) in Oracle's E-Business Suite. Other major events include a significant data breach at a Red Hat consulting GitLab instance exposing sensitive client data, a ransomware attack by the Qilin group on Japanese beverage giant Asahi, and CISA adding a Zimbra XSS flaw to its KEV catalog.",

      "excerpt": "Microsoft has issued a warning about a threat actor group, tracked as Storm-2372, that is abusing legitimate Microsoft Teams features for cyberattacks. In a report on October 7, 2025, Microsoft detailed how the group uses social engineering within Teams chats and file sharing to deliver malware, trick users into fraudulent authentication flows, and ultimately steal access tokens to hijack user sessions. The attacks are effective because they originate from within the trusted Teams environment, making users more likely to fall for the lures.",
