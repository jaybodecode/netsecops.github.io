  "summary": "In cybersecurity news for November 15-16, 2025, the landscape is dominated by the active exploitation of a critical zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-64446) in Fortinet's FortiWeb WAF, prompting an emergency directive from CISA. Concurrently, the FBI and CISA issued a stark warning about the Akira ransomware gang, which has extorted nearly $250 million from critical infrastructure sectors by exploiting VPNs. Other major developments include the discovery of an APT using two zero-days against Cisco and Citrix systems, a proposed overhaul of UK cybersecurity law, and a documented 30% surge in ransomware attacks in October, highlighting the rise of new groups like Qilin and Sinobi.",

      "excerpt": "Cybersecurity researchers report a staggering 50% increase in ransomware attacks in 2025, with over 5,000 incidents claimed on dark web leak sites by late October. This surge occurs amidst a significant realignment in the ransomware ecosystem, with formerly dominant groups fading while new and resurgent actors like Qilin take their place. The Qilin group has been particularly prolific, leading in victim counts for most of the past six months. The United States remains the most targeted nation, and the industrial sector is the most heavily impacted industry. PowerShell has become the primary tool for attackers, used in nearly 78% of observed campaigns.",

The attackers used the flaws to gain pre-authentication remote code execution and deployed custom, in-memory malware designed to evade detection. This discovery highlights a growing trend of targeting identity and access management systems at the network edge and underscores the capabilities of highly-resourced threat actors.",

The company continues to assert that no sensitive cardholder or financial data was compromised, reinforcing its initial statements. Checkout.com maintained its refusal to engage with the extortionists, reporting the incident to law enforcement. While the specific threat actor was not named in these follow-up reports, the tactics align with data extortion groups. Technical analysis suggests potential initial access via public-facing application exploits or compromised credentials, leading to data exfiltration from cloud storage. The incident underscores the persistent threat of data theft for extortion against fintech companies, even when core financial systems remain secure."
