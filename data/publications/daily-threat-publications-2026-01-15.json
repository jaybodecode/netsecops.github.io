      "excerpt": "Security researchers have discovered a massive, unprotected database on a cloud server containing the sensitive records of approximately 45 million French citizens. The data, which has since been secured, appears to be an aggregation from at least five separate breaches, compiled by a data broker or cybercriminal. The exposed archive included voter registration data, healthcare records, IBANs, and CRM contact information, creating comprehensive and dangerous profiles on a significant portion of the French population.",

      "excerpt": "Security researchers at Check Point have discovered 'VoidLink,' a highly sophisticated and modular Linux malware framework. Written in the modern Zig programming language, VoidLink is purpose-built for espionage in cloud and containerized environments. It can detect if it's running in AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, or Docker and adapt its behavior. With a plugin-based architecture inspired by Cobalt Strike, it features advanced rootkit capabilities, an in-memory plugin system, and tools for credential theft from cloud services and Git repositories. Though not yet seen in the wild, its advanced design poses a significant future threat.",

      "excerpt": "Researchers discovered a significant vulnerability in Microsoft's Copilot AI assistant that allowed for a \"Reprompt\" attack, enabling threat actors to bypass safety features, hijack user sessions, and exfiltrate data. The flaw, which has been patched in the January 2026 security update, abused URL parameters to inject hidden, follow-up prompts that executed within the victim's authenticated session. This allowed attackers to chain commands and steal information without the user's knowledge, highlighting the security risks of AI assistants processing untrusted input.",
