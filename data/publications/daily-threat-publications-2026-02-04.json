  "summary": "The cybersecurity landscape on February 4th, 2026, is dominated by sophisticated state-sponsored attacks. The Russian APT28 group was caught weaponizing a freshly patched Microsoft Office zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2026-21509) within days, targeting European entities. In a separate, long-running campaign, a Chinese APT compromised the Notepad++ update mechanism in a six-month supply chain attack. Other major incidents include the resurfacing of a massive AT&T customer dataset with 176 million records, a widespread DDoS campaign by pro-Russian hacktivists, and critical vulnerability disclosures for Django and Ingress-NGINX.",

      "excerpt": "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is facing criticism for its practice of silently updating its Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) catalog. In 2025, the agency updated 59 entries to indicate that the flaws were being used in ransomware attacks, but it did not issue any notifications for these changes. Security experts argue that this lack of communication is a significant missed opportunity for defenders, who use the ransomware designation as a key factor in prioritizing patching.",

      "excerpt": "A new phishing campaign discovered by ReliaQuest is abusing LinkedIn's private messaging feature to target executives and IT professionals. The attackers use social engineering to trick victims into downloading and running a malicious archive file. The attack's novelty lies in its use of a legitimate, open-source Python script designed for penetration testing. This 'living off the land' technique makes the malicious activity difficult to distinguish from normal administrative tasks, significantly reducing the risk of detection by security software.",
