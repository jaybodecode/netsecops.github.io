      "severity": "high",
      "excerpt": "Vietnam Airlines has suffered a massive data breach exposing the records of 7.3 million unique customers. The attack, revealed on October 11, 2025, is attributed to the 'Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters' hacking group, the same collective behind the recent Qantas breach. The compromise occurred in June 2025 when attackers gained access to the airline's Salesforce-based CRM platform. The stolen data, which includes 7.3 million unique email addresses and other personal details, was released in October. The incident highlights the growing threat of supply chain attacks targeting major software vendors like Salesforce to compromise their extensive client bases. The airline's delayed response has drawn criticism for a lack of transparency.",

      "updateContent": "The data breach attributed to 'Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters' has significantly expanded in scope, now explicitly confirming Qantas as a victim alongside Vietnam Airlines. The total number of affected customers has risen to approximately 13 million, comprising 7.32 million from Vietnam Airlines and 5.7 million from Qantas. The compromised data, stolen in June 2025 via a breach of a technology partner's Salesforce accounts, includes full names, dates of birth, email addresses, phone numbers, and loyalty program details, increasing the risk of targeted phishing and identity theft for a larger pool of individuals."

      "excerpt": "The Qilin ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation continues its campaign of double extortion, recently adding new victims to its data leak site. Among the latest targets are U.S.-based electrical equipment manufacturer Beta Dyne and Middlesex Appraisal Associates. According to research from Resecurity, the group's operational resilience is bolstered by its use of a global network of bulletproof hosting providers, making its infrastructure difficult to disrupt. The group's continued activity poses a persistent threat to organizations across various sectors, leveraging data encryption and the threat of public data release to pressure victims into paying ransoms.",

      "updateContent": "The Qilin ransomware group has significantly escalated its operations in October 2025, claiming numerous new victims across the United States, France, and Africa. This includes critical infrastructure targets like electric cooperatives, as well as healthcare authorities, real estate firms, and municipalities, demonstrating a broader and more impactful targeting strategy. The update also provides a more comprehensive list of MITRE ATT&CK techniques commonly used by Qilin affiliates, such as T1566 (Phishing) and T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) for initial access, and T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) for data exfiltration. This indicates an increased threat level and wider operational scope for the group."

      "excerpt": "Microsoft has taken decisive action to disrupt a ransomware campaign by the threat group Vanilla Tempest (also known as Vice Society), which has been targeting education and healthcare. The group was using over 200 fraudulently obtained code-signing certificates to sign counterfeit Microsoft Teams installers. These fake installers delivered the Oyster backdoor, which in turn deployed the Rhysida ransomware. By revoking the certificates from providers like DigiCert, SSL.com, and its own Trusted Signing service, Microsoft has significantly hindered the malware's ability to evade detection.",

      "excerpt": "Security researchers have uncovered a sophisticated new GNU/Linux rootkit named 'LinkPro' after investigating a compromised AWS environment. The malware demonstrates advanced stealth capabilities by leveraging extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) modules to hide its processes and files from security tools. Furthermore, it employs a novel activation mechanism, lying dormant until it receives a specially crafted 'magic packet' over the network. The initial intrusion vector was a vulnerable Jenkins server, from which the attackers deployed the rootkit via a malicious Docker image.",
