      "severity": "high",
      "excerpt": "South Korean airline Korean Air has confirmed a significant data breach affecting approximately 30,000 current and former employees. The incident occurred not on the airline's network, but at a former subsidiary and key catering supplier, Korean Air Catering & Duty-Free (KC&D). Attackers infiltrated the supplier's systems and exfiltrated sensitive employee data, including full names and bank account numbers. This supply chain attack highlights the persistent risk posed by third-party vendors, as no customer data was impacted, and the breach was confined to employee information stored on the supplier's compromised network.",

      "severity": "high",
      "excerpt": "The Kimwolf botnet has rapidly expanded to infect over 2 million devices worldwide, primarily targeting low-cost Android-based TV and streaming boxes. Active since at least mid-2025, the botnet operators monetize their network by launching large-scale DDoS attacks, surreptitiously installing applications, and selling residential proxy bandwidth. The botnet's growth is fueled by its exploitation of residential proxy networks to infect devices behind home routers, with some evidence suggesting devices are being sold pre-infected.",
