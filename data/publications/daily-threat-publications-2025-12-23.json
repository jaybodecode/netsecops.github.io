      "excerpt": "The hacktivist and digital preservation group Anna's Archive has announced it scraped and archived nearly 300 TB of data from the music streaming giant Spotify. The trove includes metadata for 256 million tracks and audio for 86 million songs, which the group plans to release via torrents. Spotify clarified this was not a system breach but a large-scale violation of its terms of service by third-party accounts created to systematically exfiltrate content. The company confirmed that no private user data like passwords or payment details were compromised and that the abusive accounts have been disabled.",

The malicious installer is packaged as a disk image for a fake messaging app, and crucially, has been both digitally signed and notarized by Apple. This abuse of Apple's own security vetting process allows the malware to appear as a trusted application, tricking users into running it and compromising their systems to exfiltrate sensitive information.",
