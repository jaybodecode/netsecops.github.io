  "summary": "This edition covers the critical cybersecurity landscape for February 1, 2026. Dominating the headlines are two actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Ivanti's EPMM, prompting an emergency CISA directive. Simultaneously, a sophisticated wiper malware attack, potentially linked to Russian state-actors like Sandworm, targeted over 30 energy facilities in Poland, aiming to disrupt critical infrastructure. Other major events include an FBI takedown of the RAMP ransomware forum, a supply chain attack compromising eScan antivirus, and an advanced vishing campaign mimicking ShinyHunters to breach SaaS platforms. These incidents highlight escalating threats against enterprise software, critical infrastructure, and the software supply chain.",

      "excerpt": "IT services giant Cognizant Technology Solutions is facing multiple class-action lawsuits in the U.S. following a significant data breach at its healthcare subsidiary, TriZetto Provider Solutions (TPS). The lawsuits, filed in New Jersey and Missouri, allege that Cognizant failed to adequately protect sensitive patient health and personal information processed by the TriZetto platform. Plaintiffs also claim the company unreasonably delayed notifying affected individuals, preventing them from taking timely steps to protect themselves from fraud and identity theft. The breach at TriZetto, a major processor of healthcare claims, has wide-ranging privacy implications for a large number of patients.",

      "updateContent": "New information reveals the TriZetto data breach, which began in November 2024, was not discovered until approximately October 2025, nearly a year after the initial intrusion. This significant delay has prolonged the risk of identity theft and fraud for affected individuals. The consequences continue to expand, with thousands of residents in Oregon now receiving notification letters regarding their exposed Protected Health Information (PHI). This update underscores the long-term impact and challenges of supply chain breaches in healthcare."

      "excerpt": "In a significant blow to the ransomware ecosystem, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has seized the RAMP (Russian Anonymous MarketPlace) forum. The Russian-language site, which operated on both the clear and dark web, was a central hub for ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations. It served as a recruitment ground for affiliates for major gangs like ALPHV/BlackCat and Qilin, a marketplace for initial access brokers, and a trading post for stolen data. The takedown, conducted with the DOJ, disrupts a key piece of infrastructure that enabled numerous high-profile cyberattacks.",

      "excerpt": "Indian antivirus provider eScan, a product of MicroWorld Technologies, has suffered a supply chain attack. On January 20, 2026, a regional update server was compromised, causing it to push a malicious file named 'Reload.exe' to enterprise and consumer customers. According to security firm Morphisec, the malware disables the antivirus product by modifying the local HOSTS file to block future updates and then proceeds with a multi-stage infection to download additional payloads. While MicroWorld Technologies acknowledged the breach and isolated the server, it has disputed the 'supply chain attack' label. Affected users require a manual cleaning utility from eScan support for remediation.",

      "excerpt": "A new cyber-espionage campaign by a Farsi-speaking threat actor dubbed 'RedKitten' is targeting human rights NGOs and activists documenting abuses in Iran. The campaign, observed by HarfangLab in January 2026, uses phishing emails with macro-laced Excel files as an initial vector. The malware is notable for its modularity and its use of legitimate public services like GitHub, Google Drive, and Telegram for C2 and payload delivery, a technique to evade detection. Researchers suspect the attackers may have used Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in the development of their sophisticated tooling, marking a potential new trend in malware creation.",

A threat actor is systematically wiping data from these unsecured servers and leaving a ransom note demanding approximately $500 in Bitcoin for its return. Research from Flare identified over 3,100 MongoDB instances accessible without authentication, with nearly half (1,400) already compromised by this attacker. This campaign highlights the persistent threat of automated scanning and exploitation of basic security misconfigurations, demonstrating that even with lower ransom demands, such attacks remain a profitable venture for criminals preying on low-hanging fruit.",

With reduced staffing and coordination at key agencies like CISA, the government's ability to detect, respond to, and share intelligence about threats is diminished. Threat actors, both criminal and nation-state, are known to exploit these periods of disruption to launch targeted phishing, credential harvesting, and ransomware campaigns against government agencies and adjacent sectors.",
