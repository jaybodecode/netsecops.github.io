      "excerpt": "The Qilin ransomware group has dramatically escalated its activities in 2025, claiming over 700 attacks to become the year's most prolific ransomware operation. Operating a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model, the Russia-based group has far surpassed the activity of 2024's leader, RansomHub. A significant surge in Qilin's attacks followed the shutdown of the RansomHub operation in April 2025, suggesting a migration of affiliates. Qilin aggressively targets critical infrastructure sectors worldwide, including healthcare, finance, and government, using double-extortion tactics.",

      "updateContent": "A new Cisco Talos report provides updated insights into the Qilin ransomware group's TTPs. The manufacturing sector is now identified as the most heavily targeted, accounting for 23% of attacks. Qilin affiliates are observed using legitimate tools like Cyberduck for data exfiltration and PsExec for lateral movement. Notably, they employ standard Windows applications such as notepad.exe and mspaint.exe to view sensitive data, a tactic likely aimed at evading detection. The report also mentions the use of two distinct encryptor variants and character encodings suggesting Russian-speaking actors."

The multi-stage attack, detailed by Push Security, aims to harvest Microsoft credentials and session cookies to bypass MFA. The attack chain leverages trusted services to appear legitimate, starting with a Google open redirect, leading to a fraudulent portal hosted on Google Firebase, and using a Cloudflare CAPTCHA to evade security bots. This non-email-based phishing vector is reportedly becoming significantly more common, accounting for over a third of recent attempts tracked by researchers.",

The company, which serves critical clients including the U.S. Department of Defense and major carriers like Verizon, stated the actor accessed several customer files stored on two laptops outside the main network. The long dwell time and the nature of the target suggest a sophisticated espionage campaign, raising serious concerns about supply chain security in the telecommunications sector.",

The alert notes a tactical shift by hacktivists from simple DDoS attacks to more disruptive intrusions into Operational Technology (OT). Authorities are urging organizations, especially in under-regulated sectors, to immediately inventory and secure exposed ICS/OT devices, recommending VPNs with 2FA and enhanced monitoring to mitigate the risk to public safety.",
