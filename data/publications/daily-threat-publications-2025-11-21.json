      "severity": "critical",
      "excerpt": "As part of its November 2025 Patch Tuesday release, Microsoft has addressed 63 security vulnerabilities, including a high-severity zero-day flaw in the Windows Kernel (CVE-2025-62215) that is confirmed to be under active exploitation. The vulnerability is a local privilege escalation (LPE) bug with a CVSS score of 7.0, allowing an attacker who has already gained initial access to a system to elevate their privileges to SYSTEM level. Such flaws are critical components in post-exploitation attack chains, enabling threat actors to take full control of a compromised machine. The update also fixes 16 remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities and numerous other flaws across the Microsoft product suite. Immediate patching is strongly recommended for all Windows users.",

      "severity": "high",
      "excerpt": "Salesforce has disclosed a significant data breach affecting its customers, stemming from a compromised connection with the Gainsight customer success application. The notorious cybercrime group ShinyHunters, also tracked as UNC6240, has claimed responsibility for the attack, stating they exploited OAuth tokens to gain unauthorized access to approximately 285 additional Salesforce instances. In response, Salesforce has revoked credentials and removed the Gainsight apps from its AppExchange. The incident highlights the growing risk of supply chain attacks targeting trusted third-party SaaS integrations to pivot into major enterprise environments.",

      "excerpt": "In a surprising move, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has voluntarily dismissed its civil enforcement action against SolarWinds and its CISO, Timothy G. Brown. The lawsuit, filed in October 2023, had accused the company and Brown of misleading investors about their cybersecurity posture before the 2020 SUNBURST supply chain attack. The dismissal is seen as a major victory for the cybersecurity community, which had feared the case would set a dangerous precedent for holding security executives personally liable for breaches and create a chilling effect on transparency.",

The '2025 State of ICS/OT Security Report' found that over 21% of organizations experienced a cyber incident in their OT environment in the past year. Of those, 40.3% suffered operational downtime. Ransomware was a primary cause, responsible for 37.9% of incidents, with unauthorized external connections being the top initial access vector. The report also points to a significant 'resilience gap,' with recovery times often exceeding one month.",
