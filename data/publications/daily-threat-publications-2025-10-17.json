      "excerpt": "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued an urgent warning for a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Forms, tracked as CVE-2025-54253. The flaw, which carries a perfect 10.0 CVSS score, allows for unauthenticated arbitrary code execution and is being actively exploited in the wild. CISA has added it to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, mandating federal agencies to patch by November 5, 2025. The vulnerability stems from a misconfiguration in JEE versions of AEM that exposes a debug servlet, allowing attackers to achieve full system compromise.",

The breach notification service 'Have I Been Pwned' has already incorporated the data set, which includes names, email addresses, and phone numbers. The incident places millions of users at a significantly higher risk of targeted phishing campaigns, identity theft, and other fraudulent activities.

      "excerpt": "The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has levied a £14 million fine against outsourcing giant Capita for significant data protection failures related to a March 2023 data breach that impacted 6.6 million people. The ICO's investigation concluded the breach was 'preventable' and heavily criticized Capita's slow incident response, noting that a compromised device remained active on the network for 58 hours after detection, allowing for further exploitation. The penalty highlights the increasing regulatory focus on the speed and efficacy of breach containment.",
