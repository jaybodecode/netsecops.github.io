      "severity": "critical",
      "excerpt": "The Akira ransomware group is actively exploiting vulnerabilities in SonicWall SSL VPN devices to gain initial access to corporate networks. By targeting these widely used, internet-facing appliances, the threat actors can establish a foothold, move laterally, exfiltrate sensitive data, and ultimately deploy the Akira ransomware payload. This campaign underscores the critical importance of promptly patching edge devices and enforcing multi-factor authentication for all remote access solutions to defend against sophisticated ransomware attacks.",

      "updateContent": "Swiss federal authorities (NCSC, fedpol) have issued a joint warning regarding a significant escalation in AKIRA ransomware attacks, impacting approximately 200 Swiss companies. Damages are in the millions of Swiss francs, with attacks intensifying to four to five per week. The primary initial access vectors are insecure remote access methods, specifically VPNs and RDP, lacking multi-factor authentication. This update highlights a broader targeting strategy beyond specific VPN vulnerabilities, emphasizing the critical need for MFA on all remote services to counter the group's intensified campaign."

      "excerpt": "Despite a slight decrease in overall weekly cyber attacks, ransomware activity has surged by 46%, according to a new report from Check Point Research. This indicates a strategic shift by threat actors towards more focused and impactful ransomware campaigns. The construction, business services, and industrial manufacturing sectors have been the most victimized, bearing the brunt of this new wave. The report identifies the Qilin ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group as one of the most prominent actors, responsible for 14.1% of publicly disclosed victims. The findings highlight an urgent need for organizations, especially in the industrial and business services sectors, to bolster their defenses against an increasingly targeted ransomware threat.",

Critically, data exfiltration is now a near-universal tactic, occurring in 96% of incidents, confirming the dominance of double-extortion. The Qilin group remains highly active. Healthcare was the most targeted public sector, while manufacturing was hardest hit in non-disclosed attacks. This update reinforces the escalating threat and the critical need for data exfiltration prevention, highlighting new mitigation strategies like DLP and network traffic analysis."
