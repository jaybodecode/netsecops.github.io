      "severity": "high",
      "excerpt": "A significant supply chain attack has compromised the popular ad-free YouTube client for Android TV, SmartTube. An attacker stole the developer's signing keys and distributed a malicious update containing surveillance-style malware through official channels. The malware, hidden in versions 30.43 through 30.55, collected device information and sent it to a command-and-control server. In response, Google Play Protect began automatically disabling the app on user devices. The developer has since revoked the compromised keys and released a new, clean version, which requires all users to perform a manual reinstallation to ensure their security.",

      "excerpt": "A coordinated international law enforcement action, codenamed \"Operation Olympia,\" has successfully dismantled Cryptomixer.io, a major cryptocurrency mixing service. Led by Swiss and German authorities with significant support from Europol and Eurojust, the takedown resulted in the seizure of servers, 12 terabytes of data, and over €25 million in Bitcoin. The service, active since 2016, is believed to have laundered over €1.3 billion for a wide range of criminal groups, including ransomware gangs and the North Korean Lazarus Group, by obfuscating the trail of illicit funds.",

      "excerpt": "The Iranian-affiliated APT group MuddyWater has been observed in a new cyberespionage campaign targeting critical infrastructure and other key sectors in Israel and Egypt. Active from late 2024 to early 2025, the campaign leverages a previously undocumented custom C/C++ backdoor named MuddyViper. The malware is delivered via a loader called Fooder, which in some cases was disguised as the classic Snake game to deceive victims. The group, also known as Mango Sandstorm, used the backdoor for espionage, credential theft, and remote command execution, and showed operational overlap with another Iranian group, Lyceum.",

      "excerpt": "A joint investigation by security researchers has exposed the inner workings of a North Korean Lazarus Group scheme where operatives commit identity fraud to get hired as remote IT workers at Western firms. By luring the threat actors into a sophisticated honeypot environment, researchers from BCA LTD, NorthScan, and ANY.RUN were able to capture their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in real-time. The scheme's goals are twofold: to gain persistent network access for espionage and to funnel salaries back to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in violation of international sanctions.",

The swift reversal marks a notable event in the ongoing global debate over digital privacy and government authority.",
