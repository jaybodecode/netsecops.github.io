  "summary": "This cybersecurity advisory for December 20, 2025, covers a surge of critical vulnerabilities and active zero-day exploits. Major vendors including HPE, WatchGuard, Cisco, Apple, and MongoDB are scrambling to patch flaws being weaponized by threat actors, with CISA issuing multiple emergency directives. Highlights include a perfect 10.0 CVSS score for an HPE OneView RCE, actively exploited zero-days in Cisco email gateways and Apple products, and a memory leak in MongoDB dubbed 'MongoBleed'. Other significant events include a major data breach at the University of Sydney, a guilty plea from a Nefilim ransomware operator, and new social engineering attacks targeting WhatsApp users.",

Stryzhak, 35, was a key operator for the ransomware group that targeted high-revenue companies in the U.S. and Europe between 2018 and 2021, causing millions in damages. The group was known for its double-extortion tactics, stealing data before encryption and threatening to leak it on their 'Corporate Leaks' site. Stryzhak faces up to 10 years in prison, while his co-conspirator, Volodymyr Tymoshchuk, remains at large with an $11 million bounty offered by the U.S. Department of State.",

      "excerpt": "Cisco has issued an urgent security advisory for an actively exploited zero-day vulnerability in its AsyncOS software, affecting Cisco Secure Email Gateway (formerly IronPort) and Secure Email and Web Manager appliances. Threat actors are leveraging the unpatched flaw to deploy persistent backdoors and tunneling tools, granting them long-term, stealthy access to enterprise email infrastructure. A patch is not yet available, and Cisco is strongly urging administrators to apply interim mitigations, restrict management access, and monitor logs for signs of compromise.",

      "excerpt": "A new social engineering campaign dubbed \"GhostPairing\" is exploiting WhatsApp's multi-device linking feature to hijack user accounts. India's CERT-In has issued a high-severity warning about the attack, which tricks victims into scanning a malicious QR code or entering a pairing code from a fraudulent website. This action links the attacker's device to the victim's account, granting them full access to messages, contacts, and media without needing a password or SIM swap. The attack bypasses traditional authentication, relying purely on deceiving the user into performing the linking action themselves.",

A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a malformed message to a vulnerable server, causing it to leak contents of its memory. This exposed data can include sensitive information like plaintext passwords, API keys, and session tokens from other user sessions. The vulnerability affects multiple versions of MongoDB, and with a PoC exploit public and active exploitation confirmed, administrators are urged to upgrade immediately or disable zlib compression as a workaround.",
