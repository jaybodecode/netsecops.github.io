  "title": "Extortion Group ShinyHunters Alleges Compromise of Crunchbase and Betterment Using Okta Voice Phishing",
  "summary": "The notorious cyber extortion syndicate ShinyHunters has claimed responsibility for breaching business intelligence firm Crunchbase and financial advisory company Betterment. According to the threat actor, the initial access was gained by using sophisticated voice phishing (vishing) attacks to socially engineer employees and compromise their Okta single sign-on (SSO) credentials. This method allows attackers to bypass weaker forms of multi-factor authentication. Neither of the targeted companies has publicly confirmed the breach.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nThe prominent cyber extortion group **ShinyHunters** has claimed to have breached **[Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/)**, a business intelligence platform, and **Betterment**, a US-based financial advisory firm. The threat actor alleged on January 24, 2026, that they achieved initial access by targeting employees with voice phishing (vishing) attacks. These attacks were designed to steal credentials and session tokens for the companies' **[Okta](https://www.okta.com/)** single sign-on (SSO) environments. This incident highlights a dangerous trend of attackers using social engineering to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA), particularly non-phishing-resistant methods like push notifications and one-time codes. As of this report, the claims have not been verified by Crunchbase or Betterment.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe core of this threat is the evolution of phishing from email-based attacks to sophisticated, interactive voice-based social engineering. By engaging a target in a real-time conversation, attackers can build trust and guide them through actions that compromise their accounts, even when protected by MFA.\n\n### Threat Actor: ShinyHunters\n- **Type:** Cyber extortion and data brokerage group.\n- **Known For:** Breaching high-profile companies and selling or leaking the stolen data on dark web forums. They are known for their skill in gaining initial access and exfiltrating large databases.\n\n### Attack Vector: Vishing for SSO Credentials\n- **Method:** The attacker calls an employee, posing as IT support or a help desk agent.\n- **Tactic:** The attacker directs the employee to a malicious website that looks identical to their company's Okta login page. As the employee enters their username and password, the attacker captures them in real-time. When the MFA prompt (e.g., a push notification or SMS code) is sent, the attacker instructs the employee to approve it or read the code back to them. This provides the attacker with the credentials and the session token needed to access the corporate network.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThis attack bypasses the security of many common MFA implementations by targeting the human element.\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK Techniques\n- **[`T1566.004 - Phishing: Vishing`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/004/):** The primary technique used for social engineering the target over the phone.\n- **[`T1555.003 - Credentials from Password Stores: Credentials from Web Browsers`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/003/):** While not directly used, the goal is the same: to obtain credentials that would be stored or used in a web browser.\n- **[`T1539 - Steal Web Session Cookie`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539/):** The ultimate goal of the vishing attack is to capture the authenticated session cookie after the user completes the MFA challenge, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user without needing to re-authenticate.\n- **[`T1133 - External Remote Services`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133/):** The compromised Okta credentials provide the attacker with access to the organization's cloud applications and other remote services.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nIf ShinyHunters' claims are true, the impact could be severe:\n*   **Full Account Takeover:** Compromising an Okta SSO account can grant the attacker access to dozens or hundreds of downstream applications connected to the identity provider, including email, source code repositories, cloud infrastructure, and HR systems.\n*   **Data Breach:** The attackers could access and exfiltrate vast amounts of sensitive data from Crunchbase (proprietary company data) and Betterment (sensitive customer financial data).\n*   **Regulatory and Financial Fallout:** For Betterment, a breach involving customer financial information would trigger significant regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, FINRA, and state regulators, likely resulting in heavy fines and lawsuits.\n*   **Loss of Trust:** For both companies, a confirmed breach originating from a failure to protect administrative access would severely damage customer and partner trust.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\nDetecting vishing-based SSO compromise requires looking for anomalies in authentication patterns.\n\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| log_source | Okta System Log | Look for a successful user login from an IP address with no company history, or from an ISP instead of a corporate network, especially if the user is typically on-prem. |\n| other | Mismatched Geolocation | An authentication request originating from one location (the user's real location) and the subsequent session activity from another (the attacker's location). |\n| other | Rapid session usage | A new session being used to access an unusual number of applications in a short period of time, indicative of attacker reconnaissance. |\n\n## Detection & Response\n*   **Detection:** Implement User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) on top of Okta logs. Configure alerts for 'impossible travel' scenarios, logins from anonymous proxies (Tor, VPNs), and unusual MFA events (e.g., multiple MFA denials followed by a success). **D3FEND** technique [`D3-UGLPA: User Geolocation Logon Pattern Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:UserGeolocationLogonPatternAnalysis) is directly applicable.\n*   **Response:** If a compromise is suspected, the immediate response is to terminate all active sessions for the user account in Okta, force a password reset, and temporarily disable the account. An investigation must then trace all actions taken by the compromised session to determine the extent of the breach.\n\n## Mitigation\n1.  **Phishing-Resistant MFA:** The most effective mitigation is to move away from phishable MFA methods. Implement FIDO2/WebAuthn (e.g., YubiKeys, Windows Hello) for all users, especially privileged ones. These methods bind the authentication to the hardware and the origin domain, making it impossible for a user to complete a login on a fake site. This is the core of **D3FEND's** [`D3-MFA: Multi-factor Authentication`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:Multi-factorAuthentication).\n2.  **User Training:** Conduct specific training on vishing attacks. Teach employees to be suspicious of unsolicited calls from 'IT support' and to never approve MFA prompts they did not initiate themselves. Establish a clear out-of-band procedure for verifying the identity of help desk staff.\n3.  **Conditional Access Policies:** Configure Okta policies to restrict logins based on risk signals, such as device posture, network location, and time of day. For example, block logins from anonymous proxies or require a phishing-resistant authenticator when logging in from an untrusted network.",
