  "title": "Makop Ransomware Campaign Leverages GuLoader, AgentTesla, and Privilege Escalation Exploits",
  "summary": "A new campaign by the Makop ransomware group is primarily targeting enterprises in India, with additional victims in Brazil and Germany. The attackers continue to use brute-force attacks against exposed RDP services for initial access. Once inside, they now use the GuLoader downloader to deliver secondary payloads like the AgentTesla and FormBook infostealers. For privilege escalation, the group is exploiting vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-7771 in the ThrottleStop driver to gain kernel-level access and disable security products before deploying the final ransomware payload.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nA new campaign by the **Makop** ransomware group, a variant of the Phobos family, has been observed deploying an updated toolset to target organizations, with a primary focus on India. According to the Acronis Threat Research Unit, the attackers' primary initial access vector remains brute-force attacks against exposed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) services. Post-compromise, the threat actors are now using the notorious **[GuLoader](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.guloader)** downloader to deliver information-stealing malware such as **AgentTesla** and **FormBook**. A key evolution in this campaign is the use of specific exploits for privilege escalation, including one targeting **CVE-2025-7771** in a third-party driver, to disable security solutions before the final **Makop** payload is executed.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe **Makop** ransomware operators are following a common ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) playbook but have refined their TTPs to improve their success rate.\n\n### Attack Chain\n1.  **Initial Access:** Attackers scan the internet for and brute-force credentials on exposed RDP services (`TCP/3389`).\n2.  **Reconnaissance:** Once on a system, they use legitimate network scanning tools like NetScan and Advanced IP Scanner to map the internal network and identify valuable targets.\n3.  **Secondary Payload Deployment:** The attackers use **GuLoader** to download and execute additional malware. **GuLoader** is known for its anti-analysis and shellcode-based delivery techniques. The secondary payloads are often infostealers like **AgentTesla** and **FormBook** to steal credentials and other sensitive data before encryption.\n4.  **Privilege Escalation:** To disable security software, the attackers exploit local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerabilities. They have been seen using an exploit for **CVE-2025-7771** in the ThrottleStop driver and another vulnerable driver, `hlpdrv.sys`, to gain kernel-level privileges.\n5.  **Defense Evasion:** With elevated privileges, the attackers terminate EDR and antivirus processes. They also deploy custom uninstallers for specific products like Quick Heal AV.\n6.  **Credential Access:** **[Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002/)** is used to dump credentials from memory, enabling lateral movement.\n7.  **Impact:** The **Makop** ransomware is executed to encrypt files across the compromised network.\n\n---\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThe most notable aspect of this campaign is the use of vulnerable drivers to achieve kernel-level privilege escalation. This 'Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver' (BYOVD) technique is highly effective for bypassing security controls.\n\n*   **CVE-2025-7771:** This vulnerability in the `ThrottleStop.sys` driver allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges, effectively giving them complete control over the operating system and allowing them to disable security agents.\n*   **GuLoader:** This downloader is known for its multi-stage, heavily obfuscated delivery mechanism, making it difficult for static analysis tools to detect.\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK TTPs\n*   **Initial Access:**\n    *   [`T1110.001 - Brute Force: Password Guessing`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/001/): Used against exposed RDP services.\n*   **Execution:**\n    *   [`T1059.001 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/): **GuLoader** often uses PowerShell to execute its shellcode.\n*   **Privilege Escalation:**\n    *   [`T1068 - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068/): Exploiting **CVE-2025-7771** to gain kernel access.\n*   **Defense Evasion:**\n    *   [`T1562.001 - Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001/): Using kernel-level access to terminate EDR/AV processes.\n    *   [`T1574.006 - Hijack Execution Flow: Dynamic-Link Library Injection`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006/): **GuLoader** uses process hollowing or injection to run its payload.\n    *   [`T1218.011 - System Binary Proxy Execution: Rundll32`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/011/): Often used to run malicious DLLs.\n*   **Credential Access:**\n    *   [`T1003 - OS Credential Dumping`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/): Use of **Mimikatz**.\n*   **Impact:**\n    *   [`T1486 - Data Encrypted for Impact`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/): The final ransomware payload encrypts files.\n\n---\n\n## Impact Assessment\nFor affected organizations, the impact is severe, consistent with other double-extortion ransomware attacks. This includes:\n*   **Operational Disruption:** Encryption of critical files and systems leads to a complete halt in business operations.\n*   **Data Breach:** The use of infostealers like **AgentTesla** and **FormBook** means that even if the ransom is not paid, sensitive corporate and customer data may have already been stolen and could be leaked or sold.\n*   **Financial Loss:** Costs include ransom payments, recovery efforts, regulatory fines, and lost revenue.\n\n---\n\n## Detection & Response\n1.  **RDP Monitoring:** Aggressively monitor RDP logs for failed login attempts from external IP addresses. Alert on a high volume of failures from a single IP. Better yet, do not expose RDP to the internet.\n2.  **Driver-Based Attacks:** Monitor for the loading of known vulnerable drivers like `ThrottleStop.sys` or `hlpdrv.sys`. EDR solutions with specific rules for BYOVD attacks can be effective here.\n3.  **Behavioral Detections:** Monitor for processes like `powershell.exe` making outbound connections to download content, or for the execution of tools like NetScan and Advanced IP Scanner from unusual user accounts.\n4.  **Credential Dumping:** Use EDR and SIEM rules to detect signs of **Mimikatz** usage, such as direct access to the LSASS process memory.\n\n---\n\n## Mitigation\n1.  **Secure RDP:** **Do not expose RDP to the public internet.** If remote access is required, place it behind a VPN with multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n2.  **Patch Management:** While the primary LPE exploit targets a third-party driver, maintaining up-to-date patches for the operating system and all applications is crucial.\n3.  **Driver Blocklisting:** Use Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) or similar technologies to create policies that block known vulnerable drivers from being loaded.\n4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that user accounts do not have local administrator privileges unless absolutely necessary. This can prevent the initial execution of some LPE exploits.",

      "recommendation": "The most effective countermeasure against the Makop ransomware campaign's initial access vector is to eliminate the exposed RDP attack surface. Organizations must immediately audit their internet-facing perimeter for any open RDP ports (TCP/3389) and place them behind a secure access solution. All RDP access should be brokered through a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or a Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) gateway that requires multi-factor authentication (MFA). This single change removes the possibility of a successful RDP brute-force attack, which is the entry point for this entire campaign. For any RDP access that must remain, implement strong password policies and account lockout thresholds to make brute-forcing computationally infeasible.",

In this case, the policy should include `ThrottleStop.sys` (related to CVE-2025-7771) and `hlpdrv.sys`. Microsoft provides a recommended driver blocklist that can be used as a starting point. By preventing these drivers from loading, the attacker's attempt to escalate to kernel-level privileges will fail, and their subsequent efforts to terminate EDR and antivirus processes will be thwarted, keeping critical security protections active.",
