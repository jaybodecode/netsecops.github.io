  "title": "Threat Actor 'Zestix' Breaches 50 Global Companies by Exploiting Stolen Credentials on Cloud Portals Lacking MFA",
  "summary": "A threat actor identified as 'Zestix' (or 'Sentap') has successfully compromised approximately 50 global enterprises by simply logging into their corporate file-sharing portals with valid credentials. According to research from Hudson Rock, the attacks were not sophisticated zero-day exploits but a direct result of a fundamental security failure: the absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA). The actor acquired credentials harvested by infostealer malware like RedLine and Lumma from infected employee devices. They then used these credentials to access sensitive data stored on platforms such as Progress ShareFile, Nextcloud, and OwnCloud. High-profile victims include Iberia Airlines and Sekisui House, highlighting a 'global epidemic of cloud exposure' and the critical, non-negotiable need for MFA across all enterprise applications.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nA threat actor known as **Zestix** (also tracked as 'Sentap') is auctioning sensitive data from approximately 50 major global companies after gaining unauthorized access to their corporate file-sharing systems. The campaign, detailed by cybersecurity firm **Hudson Rock**, highlights a critical and widespread security gap: the failure to enforce **[multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://www.cisa.gov/MFA)**. The actor utilized credentials stolen by common infostealer malware to simply 'walk through the front door' of enterprise file synchronization and sharing (EFSS) platforms, including **[Progress ShareFile](https://www.progress.com/sharefile)**, **[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)**, and **[OwnCloud](https://owncloud.com/)**. The breaches affected organizations in critical sectors like aviation, housing, and government infrastructure, with victims including **Iberia Airlines** and **Sekisui House**. This incident serves as a stark reminder that in an era of rampant infostealer infections, password-only security is obsolete, and MFA is an essential baseline control.\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe Zestix campaign epitomizes the opportunistic nature of modern cybercrime, which leverages the massive underground economy for stolen credentials. The threat actor, an initial access broker active since at least 2021, did not need to develop or purchase exploits. Instead, they capitalized on a pre-existing and growing problem: employee devices infected with infostealer malware. These malware families, such as **[RedLine](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.redline)**, **Lumma**, and **Vidar**, are designed to steal a wide range of data from infected computers, with a primary focus on credentials saved in web browsers.\n\nOnce Zestix acquires these logs from dark web marketplaces, they systematically test the stolen username/password pairs against high-value corporate targets, specifically EFSS portals. These platforms are treasure troves of sensitive data, often containing intellectual property, financial records, customer PII, and strategic plans. The success of the campaign across 50 different organizations demonstrates that the lack of MFA on externally-facing, data-rich applications is not an isolated issue but a systemic failure.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThe attack is brutally simple and effective:\n1.  **Initial Infection (Out of Scope for Zestix)**: An employee at a target company inadvertently infects their work or personal device (if used for work) with an infostealer malware like **RedLine** or **Lumma**. This often happens through phishing, malicious ads, or trojanized software downloads.\n2.  **Credential Harvesting**: The infostealer exfiltrates saved credentials from the victim's web browsers, along with other data like cookies and system information, and sends them to a C2 server.\n3.  **Data Acquisition (Zestix)**: **Zestix** purchases or acquires the infostealer logs from the malware operator or a marketplace.\n4.  **Credential Stuffing/Re-use**: The actor uses automated tools to test the stolen credentials against known corporate login portals for services like **ShareFile**, **Nextcloud**, and **OwnCloud**.\n5.  **Unauthorized Access**: When a valid credential pair is found for an account not protected by MFA, the actor gains immediate access.\n6.  **Data Exfiltration**: **Zestix** proceeds to exfiltrate large volumes of sensitive data from the compromised file-sharing portal.\n7.  **Monetization**: The actor auctions the stolen data and/or the access itself on cybercrime forums.\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK Mapping\n*   [`T1078 - Valid Accounts`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/): The core of the attack is the use of legitimate, stolen credentials to access systems.\n*   [`T1537 - Transfer Data to Cloud Account`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1537/): While the actor exfiltrates *from* a cloud account, the principle of abusing cloud storage for malicious ends applies.\n*   [`T1567.002 - Exfiltration to Cloud Storage`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/002/): The attacker exfiltrates data from the compromised corporate cloud storage to their own storage.\n*   [`T1119 - Automated Collection`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1119/): The initial credential theft is performed by automated infostealer malware.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe impact on the 50 breached companies is multifaceted and severe. Direct financial losses can result from regulatory fines (e.g., GDPR), incident response costs, and potential extortion demands. The theft of dozens or hundreds of gigabytes of data per victim exposes them to intellectual property loss, competitive disadvantage, and reputational damage. For victims like **Iberia Airlines** and **Pickett and Associates** (a utility engineering firm), the breach could have implications for operational security and critical infrastructure. This campaign demonstrates that a single, low-sophistication actor can cause widespread damage by exploiting a common, basic security oversight.\n\n## Detection & Response\n*   **Impossible Travel Alerts**: Monitor for logins to corporate accounts from geographically distant locations in a short time frame. This is a classic indicator of credential abuse.\n*   **Anomalous Data Access**: Use CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker) or native platform logging to detect unusual data access patterns, such as a single user downloading an abnormally large volume of files.\n*   **Endpoint Detection**: Deploy EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions to detect and block infostealer malware like **RedLine** and **Lumma** on employee devices before credentials can be stolen.\n*   **D3FEND Techniques**: Utilize [`D3-LAM: Local Account Monitoring`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:LocalAccountMonitoring) and [`D3-DAM: Domain Account Monitoring`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:DomainAccountMonitoring) to identify suspicious login attempts and patterns against cloud services.\n\n## Mitigation\n*   **Mandate MFA Everywhere**: The single most effective mitigation is to enforce phishing-resistant MFA on all externally accessible applications, especially those containing sensitive data like EFSS platforms. This is a non-negotiable baseline security control. This directly maps to [`M1032 - Multi-factor Authentication`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1032/).\n*   **Strong Password Policies**: While secondary to MFA, enforcing strong, unique passwords for all accounts reduces the risk of credential stuffing from other breaches. This aligns with [`M1027 - Password Policies`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1027/).\n*   **User Training**: Educate users on the dangers of infostealer malware and the importance of not saving corporate credentials in personal browser profiles. This is part of [`M1017 - User Training`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1017/).\n*   **Limit Credential Saving**: Use browser policies and endpoint management tools to prevent or limit the saving of credentials in web browsers, particularly on unmanaged devices.",

Organizations must immediately conduct an audit of all internet-facing applications, with a priority on data repositories like ShareFile, Nextcloud, and OwnCloud, to identify all accounts lacking MFA. A project should be initiated to enforce MFA across 100% of user accounts for these services. While any MFA is better than none, prioritize phishing-resistant options like FIDO2 security keys for administrators and users with access to highly sensitive data. For a broader rollout, app-based authenticators (TOTP) provide a significant security uplift over password-only access. This single defensive measure would have nullified the threat actor's primary attack vector, rendering the stolen credentials useless for accessing these specific platforms.
