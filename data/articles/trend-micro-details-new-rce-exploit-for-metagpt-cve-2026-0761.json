  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\n**[Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/)** has released information on a new high-severity remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, **[CVE-2026-0761](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-0761)**, affecting Foundation Agents **MetaGPT**. The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted HTTP request, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This type of flaw is extremely dangerous, as it can be used to gain an initial foothold in a network or to move laterally between compromised systems. Trend Micro has released a detection rule (`DDI RULE 5627`) to help customers identify exploitation attempts and is urging users to take immediate mitigation steps, including updating security products and scanning for signs of compromise.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n*   **CVE ID:** `CVE-2026-0761`\n*   **Severity:** High\n*   **Vulnerability Type:** Remote Code Execution (RCE)\n*   **Attack Vector:** Network (via HTTP request)\n*   **Description:** An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable MetaGPT agent, which leads to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the MetaGPT service. The exact nature of the flawed HTTP processing was not detailed in the initial report.\n\n## Affected Systems\n*   **Software:** Foundation Agents MetaGPT\n*   **Affected Versions:** Specific versions have not been detailed in the source material, but users of MetaGPT should assume they are at risk until confirmed otherwise by the vendor.\n\n## Exploitation Status\nWhile the Trend Micro report focuses on detection, the creation of a specific rule implies that either a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit exists or active exploitation is anticipated or has been observed. RCE vulnerabilities, especially those exploitable via HTTP, are prime targets for rapid weaponization by threat actors.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nAn RCE vulnerability in a network agent like MetaGPT can have a severe impact:\n*   **Initial Access:** If a MetaGPT agent is exposed to the internet, this vulnerability could serve as a direct entry point for an attacker into the corporate network. [`T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/)\n*   **Lateral Movement:** If an attacker has already gained a foothold in the network, they can exploit this vulnerability on other internal MetaGPT agents to move laterally and escalate their privileges. [`T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1210/)\n*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful RCE typically gives the attacker full control over the affected machine, allowing them to deploy ransomware, steal data, or use the machine as a pivot point for further attacks.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| network_traffic_pattern | Trend Micro DDI RULE 5627 | This specific network signature is designed to detect the malicious HTTP request that exploits CVE-2026-0761. |\n| url_pattern | Suspicious URI patterns in HTTP requests to MetaGPT | Look for unusually long or strangely formatted requests containing shell metacharacters. |\n| process_name | MetaGPT agent process | Monitor for the MetaGPT process spawning unexpected child processes, such as `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, or `/bin/sh`. |\n\n## Detection Methods\n*   **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS):** Deploy and update NIDS signatures, such as the one provided by Trend Micro (`DDI RULE 5627`), to detect exploit attempts over the network. This is a direct application of **D3FEND** technique [`D3-NTA: Network Traffic Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkTrafficAnalysis).\n*   **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Monitor MetaGPT agent processes for anomalous behavior, particularly the spawning of shell or scripting processes. This can detect successful exploitation.\n*   **Log Analysis:** Analyze web server logs for the MetaGPT service, looking for HTTP requests that are malformed or match patterns associated with known RCE exploits (e.g., command injection strings).\n\n## Remediation Steps\n1.  **Patch/Update:** The primary remediation is to apply a patch from the vendor as soon as it is available. Organizations should actively monitor communications from the developers of Foundation Agents MetaGPT for an update that addresses CVE-2026-0761.\n2.  **Restrict Access:** If the MetaGPT agent does not need to be accessible from the internet, ensure it is firewalled off and only available on the internal network. For internal agents, use network segmentation to restrict which other systems can communicate with them.\n3.  **Security Scanning:** After applying detection rules, scan all hosts that have triggered the alert for unrecognized files, services, or other signs of compromise.\n4.  **Password Rotation:** As a precautionary measure on any host that triggers a detection alert, change all passwords for local and service accounts.",
