  "title": "ValleyRAT Campaign Abuses Foxit PDF Reader for DLL Side-Loading to Target Job Seekers",
  "summary": "A new malware campaign is distributing the ValleyRAT remote access trojan by preying on job seekers. Attackers send emails with weaponized executables disguised as HR documents, using the Foxit PDF Reader icon as a lure. The attack leverages a legitimate, renamed Foxit executable to perform a DLL side-loading attack, which silently loads the malware while displaying a decoy document to the victim. Once active, ValleyRAT provides attackers with full control over the compromised system, enabling data theft and surveillance.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nA new malware distribution campaign is leveraging social engineering to target job seekers with the **ValleyRAT** remote access trojan. As reported by **[Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com)**, attackers are using email lures with executables disguised as compensation or benefits documents. The core of the attack is a DLL side-loading technique that abuses a legitimate, signed executable from the **[Foxit PDF Reader](https://www.foxit.com/)**. This method allows the malware to execute under the guise of a trusted process, evading basic security detections. The campaign highlights the continued effectiveness of combining social engineering with technical evasion tactics like DLL side-loading.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe attack targets individuals who are likely to be opening documents from unknown sources, such as job applicants or HR professionals. The attack chain is multi-staged and designed for stealth:\n1.  **Social Engineering:** The victim receives an email with a compressed file (e.g., a ZIP archive). Inside is an executable file named to look like a document, such as `Compensation_Benefits_Commission.exe`.\n2.  **Masquerading:** The executable uses the Foxit PDF Reader's icon to trick the user into thinking it is a safe PDF file. The file itself is a renamed, legitimate `FoxitPDFReader.exe`.\n3.  **DLL Side-Loading:** When the user runs the executable, the legitimate Foxit program is launched. However, because of the way Windows handles DLL loading, it first loads a malicious DLL (e.g., `msvcr100.dll`) that has been placed in the same directory. This is a classic example of [`T1574.002 - DLL Side-Loading`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/).\n4.  **Payload Execution:** The malicious DLL executes, launching a batch file which in turn runs a Python script. This script downloads the final ValleyRAT payload from a command-and-control (C2) server.\n5.  **Persistence:** The malware establishes persistence by creating an autorun registry key.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThe campaign's success hinges on the abuse of a trusted, signed executable. By using the legitimate `FoxitPDFReader.exe`, the attackers bypass security measures that might block unsigned or unknown executables. The DLL side-loading technique allows the malicious code to be loaded into the memory space of the trusted Foxit process, making it harder for EDR and antivirus solutions to detect.\n\nThe use of a multi-stage loading process (EXE -> DLL -> BAT -> Python -> Shellcode) is a deliberate obfuscation technique designed to break the analysis chain of automated security tools. The final payload, **ValleyRAT**, is a potent remote access trojan that gives the attacker capabilities such as:\n- Keystroke logging\n- Screen capture\n- File system access (upload/download)\n- Command execution\n- Credential theft from browsers and other applications\n\n## IOCs\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| IP Address v4 | `196.251.86.145` | Command-and-control (C2) server used to download the final payload. |\n| File Name | `Compensation_Benefits_Commission.exe` | Example name of the malicious loader executable. |\n| File Name | `msvcr100.dll` | Name of the malicious DLL used for the side-loading attack. |\n\n## Impact Assessment\nA successful infection results in the complete compromise of the victim's computer. For an individual job seeker, this can lead to the theft of personal data, banking credentials, and other sensitive information. If an HR professional is compromised, the attacker could gain a foothold into a corporate network, potentially leading to a much larger breach. The attacker could use this access to steal employee data, deploy ransomware, or conduct espionage.\n\n## Detection & Response\n- **Process Anomaly Detection:** Monitor for legitimate applications like `FoxitPDFReader.exe` loading DLLs from unusual paths (e.g., a user's `Downloads` folder instead of `C:\\Program Files\\...`). EDR solutions should be configured to alert on this behavior. This is an application of D3FEND's [`D3-PA: Process Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ProcessAnalysis).\n- **Command Line Logging:** Enable and monitor command line logging (Windows Event ID 4688). Look for `FoxitPDFReader.exe` spawning child processes like `cmd.exe` or `python.exe`, which is highly anomalous.\n- **Network IOCs:** Block the known C2 IP address (`196.251.86.145`) at the network perimeter.\n\n## Mitigation\n1.  **User Training:** Educate users, especially job seekers and HR staff, to be extremely cautious of executable files disguised as documents. Teach them to check file extensions and be wary of files arriving in ZIP archives.\n2.  **Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) Rules:** Implement Microsoft Defender ASR rules, such as \"Block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criterion,\" to prevent novel malicious executables from running.\n3.  **Application Control:** Where possible, use application control solutions like AppLocker to prevent applications from running from user-writable directories like `Downloads` or `AppData`.\n4.  **Email Security:** Use an email gateway that can scan inside archives and identify suspicious executables, even if they are renamed or use legitimate icons.",

Furthermore, another critical detection is to alert when `FoxitPDFReader.exe` (or any similar document reader) spawns a child process that is a command-line interpreter (`cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`) or scripting engine (`python.exe`). This behavior is fundamentally anomalous for a document viewer and is a strong indicator of a successful DLL side-loading compromise.",
