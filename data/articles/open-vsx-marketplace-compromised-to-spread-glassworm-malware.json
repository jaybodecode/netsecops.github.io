  "summary": "On January 30, 2026, the Open VSX Registry, a popular marketplace for Visual Studio Code extensions, fell victim to a supply chain attack. Threat actors compromised the account of a legitimate developer, 'oorzc', and published malicious updates to four of their popular extensions. These updates embedded the 'GlassWorm' malware loader. The compromised extensions had been downloaded over 22,000 times, exposing a large number of developers to the malware before the malicious versions were removed by the Open VSX security team.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nOn January 30, 2026, the **[Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/)**, an open-source alternative to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace, was targeted in a supply chain attack. According to security firm **Socket**, threat actors compromised the publishing credentials of a developer known as \"oorzc\" and used the access to inject malware into four established extensions. The malicious updates contained a malware loader dubbed **GlassWorm**. These extensions, trusted by the community and downloaded over 22,000 times, became an unwitting distribution vector for the malware. The incident highlights the growing trend of attackers targeting developer ecosystems and abusing trusted relationships to propagate malware. The **Open VSX** team has since removed the compromised extensions.\n\n## Threat Overview\nThis attack is a clear example of a trusted dependency compromise. The attackers did not create new, suspicious extensions; instead, they hijacked existing, popular ones that had been available for over two years. By compromising the developer's account ([`T1078 - Valid Accounts`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/)), likely through a leaked publishing token or credential theft, the attackers were able to publish new versions of the extensions that appeared legitimate. Developers who had the extensions installed would have received the malicious update automatically through their IDE's standard update process. The embedded **GlassWorm** malware is described as a loader, meaning its primary purpose is to gain an initial foothold on the developer's machine and then download and execute additional, more damaging payloads.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThe attack leveraged the trust inherent in the package manager ecosystem.\n\n1.  **Initial Access (to developer account)**: The threat actor gained access to the 'oorzc' developer account. This likely involved techniques such as phishing, credential stuffing, or finding a leaked API token/credential, which falls under [`T1078 - Valid Accounts`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/).\n2.  **Compromise Software Supply Chain**: The attacker then published malicious versions of legitimate software. This is a direct example of [`T1195.002 - Compromise Software Supply Chain`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/002/), specifically by compromising a software development tool.\n3.  **Execution**: When a developer's VS Code instance automatically updated the compromised extension, the malicious code, including the **GlassWorm** loader, would be executed within the context of the IDE. This could be achieved via `post-install` scripts or by modifying the extension's core JavaScript files ([`T1059.007 - JavaScript`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/007/)).\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe impact of this attack is twofold. First, the more than 22,000 developers who downloaded the compromised extensions are at risk. A compromised developer machine is a highly valuable target, as it can be used to inject malicious code into the software that developer produces, creating a cascading supply chain catastrophe. Second, the incident damages trust in the **Open VSX** ecosystem and open-source registries in general. Users must now be more vigilant about the extensions they install and the updates they receive. The potential for data theft (source code, credentials, private keys) from infected developers is extremely high.\n\n## Detection & Response\n1.  **Audit Extensions**: Developers using VS Code (especially with the **Open VSX** registry) should immediately review their list of installed extensions. Check for the four compromised extensions from developer 'oorzc' and uninstall them. The **Open VSX** team has removed the malicious versions, but local copies may persist.\n2.  **Scan for IOCs**: Security teams should scan developer workstations for IOCs related to **GlassWorm**. While not publicly available yet, this would include file hashes, C2 domains, and specific registry keys or file paths used for persistence.\n3.  **Credential Rotation**: Any developer who had the malicious extensions installed should consider their machine compromised and immediately rotate all credentials stored on or accessed from that machine. This includes Git tokens, SSH keys, cloud provider API keys, and password manager master passwords.\n4.  **Monitor IDE Processes**: Use an EDR to monitor processes spawned by VS Code (`Code.exe`). Look for anomalous behavior, such as unexpected network connections, file system activity outside of the project workspace, or the execution of shell commands.\n\n## Mitigation\n1.  **Enforce MFA on Developer Accounts**: All developer accounts on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and package registries like **Open VSX** must be protected with strong multi-factor authentication ([`M1032 - Multi-factor Authentication`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1032/)). This is the most effective way to prevent account takeovers via credential theft.\n2.  **Use Scoped, Short-Lived Tokens**: Developers should use publishing tokens that are narrowly scoped to specific packages and have short expiration dates. This limits the window of opportunity for an attacker if a token is leaked.\n3.  **Vet Dependencies**: Before installing a new extension or dependency, perform basic vetting. Check its download count, reviews, and the publisher's history. Utilize tools that can scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n4.  **Principle of Least Privilege**: Run development tools with the lowest possible user privileges. Avoid running VS Code as an administrator, as this would give a compromised extension full control over the system.",
