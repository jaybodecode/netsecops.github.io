  "title": "Phishing Campaign Targets European Organizations with HTML Smuggling and Exfiltrates Credentials via Telegram Bot API",
  "summary": "A sophisticated phishing campaign is targeting organizations across Central and Eastern Europe, using HTML smuggling to deliver credential harvesting forms. Researchers at Cyble discovered the attack, which uses malicious HTML file attachments to bypass email security filters. Once a victim enters their credentials into the fake login page, an embedded JavaScript code exfiltrates the data directly to the attackers' private Telegram channels via the Telegram Bot API. This technique makes the campaign highly evasive, as it avoids the use of traditional, blockable C2 infrastructure.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nSecurity researchers at **[Cyble](https://cyble.com/)** have identified a widespread and evasive phishing campaign targeting various industries in Central and Eastern Europe, including Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. The attackers are using a technique known as **HTML smuggling**, embedding a credential harvesting form within an HTML file attached to an email. This method often bypasses traditional email security scanners that are focused on URLs in the email body. In a further act of evasion, the campaign uses the legitimate **[Telegram](https://telegram.org/)** Bot API to exfiltrate stolen credentials, eliminating the need for attackers to set up and maintain their own command-and-control (C2) infrastructure. This makes the operation resilient and difficult to disrupt.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe campaign targets a wide range of sectors, including manufacturing, government, telecommunications, energy, and automotive. The attack begins with a spear-phishing email, often disguised as a business document like a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The email contains an HTML attachment.\n\nWhen the victim opens the HTML file in their browser, it renders a fake login page for a well-known service like Microsoft or Adobe. The entire phishing page is self-contained within the HTML file. Any credentials entered by the victim are captured by a JavaScript function embedded within the same file. The script then makes a POST request to `api.telegram.org`, sending the stolen username and password to a private Telegram channel controlled by the attacker.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThis campaign demonstrates several effective defense evasion and C2 techniques:\n1.  **Initial Access** ([`T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/)): The use of an HTML attachment is key. Because the malicious content is inside the attachment, email gateways may not flag the email itself as dangerous.\n2.  **Defense Evasion** ([`T1027.006 - HTML Smuggling`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/006/)): The phishing form is 'smuggled' past defenses inside the HTML file. There is no malicious URL to block in the email itself; the threat is activated locally when the file is opened.\n3.  **Command and Control** ([`T1102.001 - Dead Drop Resolver`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102/001/)): The use of the Telegram Bot API is a form of C2 over a legitimate, widely used service. It is difficult for organizations to block `api.telegram.org` outright, as it may be used for legitimate business purposes. This makes the C2 channel highly resilient.\n4.  **Defense Evasion** ([`T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/)): Researchers noted that attackers are iterating on their methods, beginning to use libraries like CryptoJS to encrypt the stolen data before exfiltration, further hiding their activity.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe direct impact of this campaign is credential theft. Compromised credentials can be used for a wide range of malicious activities, including:  \n-   Business Email Compromise (BEC) and financial fraud.\n-   Accessing and stealing sensitive corporate data.\n-   Gaining a foothold in the network for follow-on attacks, such as ransomware deployment.\n-   Selling the credentials on dark web markets.\n\nBecause the campaign targets multiple industries, including critical sectors like energy and government, the potential for significant economic and national security impact is high.\n\n## IOCs\nThe primary network indicator for this campaign is traffic to the Telegram Bot API endpoint.\n\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| URL | `https://api.telegram.org/bot[BOT_ID]/sendMessage` | Pattern for exfiltration requests to the Telegram API. |\n\n## Detection & Response\n- **Egress Traffic Filtering**: The most effective detection is to monitor and alert on all outbound network connections to `api.telegram.org` from corporate workstations. Unless your organization has a specific business need for Telegram, consider blocking this traffic entirely at the firewall or web proxy. Use D3FEND's [`Outbound Traffic Filtering`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:OutboundTrafficFiltering).\n- **Email Attachment Analysis**: Configure email security gateways to treat HTML and HTM attachments as high-risk. If possible, use a sandbox to open attachments and analyze their behavior, such as whether they make outbound network connections.\n- **Endpoint Monitoring**: Use EDR to monitor for browsers making POST requests to `api.telegram.org`. This is highly anomalous behavior for a standard user workstation.\n\n## Mitigation\n1.  **Block/Control HTML Attachments**: Implement email gateway policies to block, quarantine, or strip HTML/HTM attachments from external emails. If blocking is not feasible, use a 'safe attachments' feature that renders them as PDFs or in a secure viewer.\n2.  **User Training** ([`M1017 - User Training`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1017/)): Train users to be suspicious of all email attachments, especially unexpected ones, even if they appear to be simple document types like HTML. Emphasize that login prompts should only be trusted when the user has navigated to the site themselves.\n3.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** ([`M1032 - Multi-factor Authentication`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1032/)): Enforcing MFA is the most effective control against the use of stolen credentials. Even if an employee's password is stolen in this attack, MFA will prevent the attacker from using it to log in.\n4.  **Web Filtering**: While the initial email does not contain a malicious URL, web filters can still be used to block connections to `api.telegram.org` as a C2 channel.",

The most direct countermeasure is to control outbound network traffic. Security teams should immediately assess whether there is a legitimate business need for access to `api.telegram.org`. If not, this domain should be blocked at the network perimeter via firewall or web proxy. If some access is required, it should be restricted to only specific source IPs. For all other endpoints, any attempted connection to this domain should be blocked and trigger a high-priority security alert. This single action effectively cuts off the attacker's ability to receive stolen credentials, neutralizing the entire campaign even if a user falls for the initial phish.",

      "recommendation": "To combat HTML smuggling, email security gateways must be configured for deep file analysis of attachments. Instead of just scanning for known malicious signatures, the system should be set to analyze the content and behavior of HTML files. Configure policies to quarantine any HTML attachment that contains embedded scripts, forms, or obfuscated code. Better yet, use an email sandboxing solution that can automatically 'detonate' the HTML attachment in a secure, isolated environment and observe its behavior. If the sandbox detects the file attempting to make an outbound network connection to a suspicious domain like `api.telegram.org`, the email can be blocked before it ever reaches the user's inbox. This proactive analysis defeats the core evasion tactic of the attack.",

All accounts, especially those for critical services like Microsoft 365 and Adobe which were impersonated in this campaign, must be protected with MFA. Prioritize the use of phishing-resistant authenticators like FIDO2 security keys. Even if this phishing attack successfully tricks a user into entering their username and password into the fake form, the attacker will be unable to use those credentials to access the account without the second factor. This control is the single most effective defense against credential-based attacks.",
