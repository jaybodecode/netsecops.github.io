  "summary": "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Oracle Identity Manager, CVE-2025-61757, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. The flaw, with a CVSS score of 9.8, allows an unauthenticated attacker to achieve RCE by chaining an authentication bypass with a code injection flaw in a Groovy script endpoint. Evidence of in-the-wild exploitation, including scans detected weeks before a patch was available, has prompted CISA to issue a patching deadline of December 12, 2025, for federal agencies.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\n\nThe **[U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov)** has issued a critical warning regarding **[CVE-2025-61757](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)**, a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in **[Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/)** Fusion Middleware Identity Manager. The flaw, rated 9.8 out of 10.0 on the CVSS scale, is being actively exploited in the wild, leading to its addition to CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. The vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to completely compromise affected systems. It impacts Oracle Identity Manager versions `12.2.1.4.0` and `14.1.2.1.0`. Due to the confirmed exploitation and severe risk, CISA has mandated that all Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies must apply Oracle's patch, released in October 2025, by December 12, 2025. All organizations using the affected software are urged to patch immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n\nThe vulnerability, **CVE-2025-61757**, is a combination of two distinct issues that can be chained together to achieve pre-authentication RCE.\n\n1.  **Authentication Bypass**: The root cause is a \"missing authentication for critical function\" flaw. Researchers at Searchlight Cyber discovered that a security filter in Oracle Identity Manager could be tricked into treating protected REST API endpoints as public. An attacker can achieve this simply by appending a specific parameter, such as `?WSDL` or `;.wadl`, to the URL path of a protected resource. This bypasses the authentication check entirely.\n\n2.  **Code Injection**: Once authentication is bypassed, the attacker can send a request to a normally protected Groovy script endpoint. This endpoint was intended for benign purposes like syntax checking. However, it is vulnerable to code injection through Groovy's annotation-processing features. An attacker can craft a malicious script that is executed at compile time on the server, leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\nThe combination of these two flaws makes the exploit \"somewhat trivial,\" according to researchers, as it does not require any credentials or user interaction.\n\n## Exploitation Status\n\n**[CISA](https://www.cisa.gov)** has confirmed active exploitation of **CVE-2025-61757**. This is corroborated by researchers at the SANS Technology Institute, who observed multiple HTTP POST requests targeting the vulnerable endpoint between August 30 and September 9, 2025. These attempts occurred weeks before **[Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/)** released a patch on October 21, 2025, indicating the vulnerability was exploited as a zero-day. The scans originated from multiple IP addresses but shared a common user agent, suggesting a single threat actor was likely behind the initial exploitation campaign. The addition of the flaw to the KEV catalog underscores the immediate and ongoing threat.\n\n## Affected Systems\n\n*   **[Oracle Fusion Middleware Identity Manager](https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/identity-management/identity-manager.html)**, version `12.2.1.4.0`\n*   **Oracle Fusion Middleware Identity Manager**, version `14.1.2.1.0`\n\nOrganizations using these specific versions are highly vulnerable and should prioritize remediation.\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\nA successful exploit of **CVE-2025-61757** grants an attacker complete control over the underlying Oracle Identity Manager server. As an identity and access management (IAM) solution, this system is a high-value target. A compromise could lead to:\n*   Creation of rogue administrator accounts.\n*   Modification or theft of all user credentials managed by the system.\n*   Lateral movement into other integrated enterprise applications.\n*   Complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the IAM infrastructure.\n\nFor government agencies and large enterprises that rely on this product, a compromise could be catastrophic, enabling widespread unauthorized access across the organization's entire IT landscape.\n\n## IOCs\n\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| ip_address_v4 | `89.238.132.76` | Source IP observed in scanning activity. |\n| ip_address_v4 | `185.245.82.81` | Source IP observed in scanning activity. |\n| ip_address_v4 | `138.199.29.153` | Source IP observed in scanning activity. |\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n\n| Type | Value | Description | Context | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| url_pattern | `*?WSDL` | Exploitation attempts may include this string appended to a URL path to bypass authentication. | WAF, Reverse Proxy Logs, Web Server Logs | high |\n| url_pattern | `*;.wadl` | An alternative string used in exploitation attempts to bypass authentication. | WAF, Reverse Proxy Logs, Web Server Logs | high |\n| url_pattern | `*/iam/admin/v1/GroovyScript` | The likely path to the vulnerable Groovy script endpoint. Monitor for POST requests to this path from unauthenticated sources. | WAF, Web Server Logs | high |\n| process_name | `java.exe` | Suspicious child processes spawning from the main Oracle WebLogic Java process (e.g., `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `/bin/sh`). | EDR, Host-based monitoring | high |\n\n## Detection Methods\n\nSecurity teams should focus on both network and host-based detection.\n\n1.  **Web Log Analysis**: Ingest web server, reverse proxy, and WAF logs into a SIEM. Create detection rules to alert on requests to Oracle Identity Manager paths that contain the `?WSDL` or `;.wadl` strings, especially if followed by a POST request to a script endpoint. This is a direct application of **[D3-NTA: Network Traffic Analysis](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkTrafficAnalysis)**.\n\n2.  **EDR Monitoring**: On the Oracle server, monitor the Java process associated with WebLogic Server for any suspicious child process creation. The application should not be spawning shells or command-line interpreters. This falls under **[D3-PA: Process Analysis](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ProcessAnalysis)**.\n\n3.  **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use authenticated vulnerability scanners to check for the presence of vulnerable Oracle Identity Manager versions `12.2.1.4.0` and `14.1.2.1.0`.\n\n## Remediation Steps\n\nThe primary remediation is to apply the security updates released by **[Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/)** in its October 2025 Critical Patch Update (CPU).\n\n1.  **Patch Immediately**: Prioritize the deployment of the patch for **CVE-2025-61757** on all internet-facing and internal Oracle Identity Manager instances. This is a form of **[D3-SU: Software Update](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SoftwareUpdate)**.\n\n2.  **Workaround (Temporary)**: If patching is not immediately possible, implement strict access control rules on a WAF or reverse proxy to block any requests containing the patterns `?WSDL` or `;.wadl` directed at the Oracle Identity Manager application. This is a compensating control but should not replace patching. This is a form of **[D3-ITF: Inbound Traffic Filtering](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:InboundTrafficFiltering)**.\n\n3.  **Assume Compromise**: Given the evidence of zero-day exploitation, organizations with vulnerable, internet-exposed systems should assume compromise and initiate threat hunting activities to look for signs of persistence or lateral movement.",

Given that this vulnerability is being actively exploited as a zero-day and is now part of the CISA KEV catalog, patching cannot be delayed. Organizations must activate their emergency patching procedures. Priority should be given to any internet-facing Oracle Identity Manager instances, as they are the most exposed. Following that, all internal instances must be patched to prevent lateral movement. Patching should be managed through a centralized patch management system to ensure complete coverage and verification.

This virtual patch directly targets the authentication bypass vector of the exploit chain. While effective against the known public exploit method, attackers may discover alternative bypass strings, so this should not be considered a permanent fix.
