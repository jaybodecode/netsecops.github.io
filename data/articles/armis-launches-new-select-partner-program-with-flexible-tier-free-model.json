  "summary": "Armis, a leader in cyber exposure management, has launched its new Armis Select Partner Program. The revamped global channel initiative moves away from traditional, rigid tiers in favor of a flexible, three-route model: selling, delivering services, and building solutions. This approach allows partners to engage with Armis in a way that best suits their business model, aiming to accelerate the adoption of the Armis Centrix platform and build a more collaborative partner ecosystem.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\n**[Armis](https://www.armis.com/)**, a company specializing in asset visibility and security, has overhauled its global channel strategy with the launch of the **Armis Select Partner Program**. This new program abandons the conventional tiered structure (e.g., Gold, Silver, Bronze) common in the industry. Instead, it offers partners a more flexible and tailored framework based on three distinct engagement routes: 'Selling,' 'Delivering Services,' and 'Building Solutions.' This modern approach is designed to empower partners to leverage their unique strengths, whether they are a traditional reseller, a managed security service provider (MSSP), or a technology integration partner. The ultimate goal is to expand the reach of the **Armis Centrix™** platform and foster a more dynamic and outcome-focused partner ecosystem.\n\n## Program Details\nThe Armis Select Partner Program is structured around three main engagement paths:\n\n1.  **Selling Route:** This path is for traditional resellers, VARs, and distribution partners focused on selling Armis Centrix licenses. They receive support for sales and marketing activities, deal registration incentives, and training to effectively position the platform to customers.\n\n2.  **Services Route:** This path is designed for partners who deliver professional, managed, or advisory services. This includes MSSPs, incident response firms, and consultants. Armis provides these partners with the tools, training, and technical support needed to build a successful service practice around the Armis Centrix platform, helping customers with deployment, optimization, and ongoing management.\n\n3.  **Building Route:** This path is for technology partners, such as Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) and system integrators, who build joint solutions or integrations with the Armis platform. These partners gain access to Armis's APIs and developer support to create complementary offerings that enhance the value of the ecosystem.\n\nPartners can choose to participate in one or more routes, with clear commitments and benefits tied to each path. This transparency ensures partners understand exactly what is required and what they will receive in return.\n\n## Strategic Impact\n- **Increased Flexibility:** The non-tiered model removes the pressure on partners to meet arbitrary revenue targets or certification numbers that may not align with their business model. It allows a boutique incident response firm to be just as valued as a large global reseller.\n- **Focus on Value, Not Volume:** The program encourages partners to focus on their core competencies and deliver real value to customers, whether through expert sales advice, managed services, or innovative integrations.\n- **Ecosystem Growth:** By making the program more accessible and attractive to a wider variety of partner types, Armis aims to rapidly scale its ecosystem and accelerate the adoption of its Centrix platform across different markets and verticals.\n- **Improved Customer Outcomes:** A more specialized and capable partner network ultimately leads to better outcomes for customers, who can choose a partner that best fits their specific needs for procurement, implementation, or management.\n\n## Industry Context\nThis move by Armis reflects a broader trend in the IT channel away from rigid, one-size-fits-all partner programs. As customer buying habits evolve and the role of partners shifts from simple fulfillment to strategic advising and service delivery, vendors are adapting their programs to be more flexible, collaborative, and value-based. The positive feedback from initial partners like Carahsoft and Orange CyberDefense suggests the new model is well-aligned with the current needs of the channel.",
