  "summary": "France's national cybersecurity agency, CERT-FR, has issued a security advisory for two critical vulnerabilities in Wireshark, the world's most popular network protocol analyzer. The flaws, identified as CVE-2025-13945 and CVE-2025-13946, can be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This poses a significant risk to security operations, as an attacker could crash the tool during a live incident investigation, effectively blinding security analysts. Users are urged to update to the patched versions (4.4.12 and 4.6.2) to mitigate the risk.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nOn December 6, 2025, France's computer emergency response team, [**CERT-FR**](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/), issued a security advisory (CERTFR-2025-AVI-1062) for two critical vulnerabilities in **Wireshark**, the ubiquitous network protocol analyzer. The vulnerabilities, tracked as **CVE-2025-13945** and **CVE-2025-13946**, could allow a remote attacker to trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the Wireshark application to crash or become unresponsive. This presents a tactical risk to security operations, as it targets a tool essential for network analysis and incident response. Security professionals are strongly advised to update their installations to the latest patched versions.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\nThe advisory covers two distinct vulnerabilities that both lead to a denial-of-service outcome. While the specific technical root cause for each is not detailed in the summary, they can be triggered remotely. This typically means an attacker could cause a vulnerable version of Wireshark to crash by sending specially crafted packets over the network, which Wireshark then captures, or by convincing an analyst to open a malicious packet capture file.\n\n- **CVE-2025-13945:** A vulnerability in one of Wireshark's many protocol dissectors that leads to a crash when parsing a malformed packet.\n- **CVE-2025-13946:** A separate vulnerability, likely in a different dissector, that also results in a DoS condition.\n\nSuccessful exploitation of either vulnerability results in the immediate termination or resource exhaustion of the Wireshark application. This is a form of [`T1499 - Endpoint Denial of Service`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/).\n\n## Affected Systems\nThe vulnerabilities affect the following versions of Wireshark:\n-   Wireshark versions `4.4.x` prior to `4.4.12`\n-   Wireshark versions `4.6.x` prior to `4.6.2`\n\nThe software is cross-platform, so Windows, macOS, and Linux installations are all affected.\n\n## Exploitation Status\nThere is no mention of active exploitation in the wild. However, vulnerabilities in a tool as widely used as Wireshark are often quickly weaponized by threat actors, either for targeted disruption or broader nuisance attacks.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe primary impact of these vulnerabilities is not on data confidentiality or integrity, but on the **availability** of a critical security analysis tool. For a Security Operations Center (SOC) or incident response team, the impact is strategic:\n- **Disruption of Incident Response:** An attacker could knowingly trigger the crash while a security analyst is investigating their activity, effectively blinding the response team and allowing the attacker to proceed undetected.\n- **Hindrance of Forensic Analysis:** If the vulnerability is triggered by a malicious capture file, it could prevent analysts from examining crucial evidence related to a security incident.\n- **Targeted Harassment:** The vulnerabilities could be used to repeatedly crash the tools of specific security researchers or analysts, hindering their work.\n\n## Detection Methods\nThe most effective way to detect exposure to this vulnerability is through asset and version management.\n- **Software Inventory:** Maintain a complete inventory of all software installed on corporate endpoints, including security tools like Wireshark.\n- **Version Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanners or endpoint management tools to identify all instances of Wireshark and check their version numbers against the list of affected versions.\n\n## Remediation Steps\nThe solution is straightforward: update the software. This is a direct application of D3FEND's [`Software Update`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SoftwareUpdate) countermeasure.\n\n1.  **Update Wireshark:** All users should immediately download and install the latest stable version of Wireshark. The patched versions are:\n    -   **4.4.12** (for the 4.4 branch)\n    -   **4.6.2** (for the 4.6 branch)\n2.  **Verify Installation:** After updating, verify that the new version is running by checking the 'About Wireshark' dialog.\n3seminar **Policy Enforcement:** For enterprise environments, use software deployment tools to push the update to all managed endpoints. Consider creating a policy that restricts the use of outdated, vulnerable versions of security tools.",

      "recommendation": "The immediate and primary countermeasure is to update all instances of Wireshark to a patched version (4.4.12 or 4.6.2 and later). In an enterprise setting, system administrators should use software deployment systems (e.g., SCCM, Jamf, or Ansible) to push the updated package to all developer and security analyst workstations. A vulnerability management program should be used to scan the environment to confirm that all vulnerable versions have been successfully removed. Since Wireshark is often installed manually by users, communication to all technical staff is essential to ensure they update their personal installations.",
