  "summary": "The initial access broker (IAB) known as Storm-0249 is evolving its tactics, moving beyond simply selling network access to actively participating in malware deployment. According to ReliaQuest, the group now uses more sophisticated techniques, including DLL side-loading and fileless PowerShell execution, to facilitate ransomware attacks directly. Their methods involve social engineering victims into running malicious commands (`ClickFix`), which fetch and execute PowerShell scripts from spoofed domains. A key technique is dropping a trojanized version of a SentinelOne security agent DLL to run malware under the guise of a trusted process. This evolution signifies a dangerous trend where IABs are becoming more integrated into the ransomware deployment process, increasing their threat level.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nThe threat actor **Storm-0249**, previously known primarily as an Initial Access Broker (IAB) that sold network access to other cybercrime groups, is evolving its tactics to become a more direct participant in malware and ransomware deployment. Research from **[ReliaQuest](https://www.reliaquest.com/)** shows the group adopting more sophisticated and stealthy techniques, including DLL side-loading and fileless execution. This marks a significant shift from their previous business model of simply finding and selling access, to now being a hands-on enabler of the final payload. The group's updated TTPs, which involve social engineering via the \"ClickFix\" method and abusing legitimate security software for defense evasion, indicate a move towards higher-tier operations and a deeper integration with ransomware affiliates.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\n**Storm-0249** is transitioning from a specialized IAB into a more versatile threat actor. This evolution suggests the group is either starting its own ransomware operations or working in a much closer partnership with specific ransomware gangs.\n\nThe group's updated modus operandi includes several key components:\n*   **Social Engineering:** Using the \"ClickFix\" technique to trick users into running malicious code.\n*   **Fileless Execution:** Leveraging `curl.exe` and `PowerShell` to download and run malware in memory, avoiding writing files to disk.\n*   **Defense Evasion:** Employing DLL side-loading against a legitimate, signed security agent executable to bypass security controls.\n*   **Ransomware Enablement:** Performing reconnaissance steps, like gathering the `MachineGuid`, which are specifically used by ransomware families like LockBit and ALPHV.\n\nThis tactical shift makes **Storm-0249** a more dangerous and potent threat, as they now control more of the attack chain from initial access to final impact.\n\n---\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThe new attack chain observed by ReliaQuest is multi-staged and focuses on stealth:\n\n1.  **Initial Access (Social Engineering):** The attack begins with the \"ClickFix\" technique. The victim is lured (e.g., via a phishing email or malicious ad) to a webpage with instructions to 'fix' a supposed technical issue. The fix involves the user copying a command and pasting it into the Windows Run dialog (`Win+R`) ([`T1204.002 - Malicious File`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002/), but with user-pasted commands).\n2.  **Fileless Payload Retrieval:** The command uses the native Windows `curl.exe` binary to download a PowerShell script from an actor-controlled domain (e.g., `sgcipl[.]com/us.microsoft.com/bdo/`). The script is piped directly into PowerShell for execution, a fileless technique to avoid on-disk scanners ([`T1059.001 - PowerShell`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/)).\n3.  **Privileged Execution:** The PowerShell script executes a malicious MSI package, which runs with SYSTEM privileges.\n4.  **DLL Side-Loading (Defense Evasion):** This is the core of the new TTP. The MSI installer drops two files into a directory:\n    *   `SentinelAgentWorker.exe`: The legitimate, signed executable from the **[SentinelOne](https://www.sentinelone.com/)** security agent.\n    *   `SentinelAgentCore.dll`: A malicious, trojanized DLL with the same name as a legitimate DLL required by the executable.\n    When `SentinelAgentWorker.exe` is run, the operating system loads the malicious DLL from the same directory instead of the legitimate one. This allows the attacker's code to run within the context of a trusted, signed process, evading application control and some EDR detections ([`T1574.002 - Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/)).\n5.  **Reconnaissance for Ransomware:** The malicious DLL gathers the system's `MachineGuid`, a unique identifier. This is a known precursor for ransomware attacks, as groups like LockBit use this GUID to generate unique encryption keys for each victim.\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK Mapping\n| Tactic | Technique ID | Name | Description |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Initial Access | `T1566.002` | Phishing: Spearphishing Link | The ClickFix technique is initiated through a lure, likely from a phishing campaign. |\n| Execution | `T1059.001` | PowerShell | The actor uses fileless PowerShell to download and execute the next stage. |\n| Defense Evasion | `T1574.002` | Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading | Abusing the SentinelOne agent executable to load a malicious DLL is the key evasion tactic. |\n| Defense Evasion | `T1218.011` | System Binary Proxy Execution: Rundll32 | The ClickFix method often uses `rundll32.exe` to execute the initial command. |\n| Discovery | `T1082` | System Information Discovery | The malware gathers the `MachineGuid` as part of its reconnaissance phase. |\n\n---\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe evolution of **Storm-0249** increases the overall risk to organizations. By bringing malware deployment in-house, the group can:\n\n*   **Increase Attack Speed:** The time from initial access to ransomware deployment can be significantly shortened, giving defenders less time to react.\n*   **Improve Stealth:** The use of advanced evasion techniques like DLL side-loading makes detection more difficult for traditional security tools.\n*   **Maintain Operational Control:** By controlling the full attack chain, the group can ensure their methods work and are not discovered by a less-skilled 'customer' (another ransomware group).\n\nThis trend signifies a maturation in the cybercrime ecosystem, where specialized actors are verticalizing their operations to increase efficiency and profitability.\n\n---\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n\n| Type | Value | Description | Context | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| command_line_pattern | `curl.*\\|.*powershell` | The use of `curl` to download content and pipe it directly into a PowerShell process is a classic fileless execution pattern. | EDR, Sysmon (Event ID 1), PowerShell Script Block Logging (Event ID 4104). | high |\n| file_name | `SentinelAgentCore.dll` | The presence of this DLL outside of the legitimate SentinelOne installation path is highly suspicious. | File integrity monitoring, EDR file creation events. | high |\n| process_name | `SentinelAgentWorker.exe` | Monitor for this process running from an unusual directory (i.e., not its default Program Files location). | EDR, Sysmon (Event ID 1). | high |\n| domain | `sgcipl.com` | The domain used to host the malicious PowerShell script. Should be blocked. | DNS logs, proxy logs, firewall logs. | high |\n\n---\n\n## Detection & Response\n\n*   **PowerShell Logging:** Enable PowerShell Script Block Logging (Event ID 4104) and Module Logging. This will capture the content of fileless scripts, allowing for analysis even if they never touch the disk.\n*   **EDR Monitoring:** A capable EDR is essential for detecting DLL side-loading. It should be able to correlate the execution of a signed binary (`SentinelAgentWorker.exe`) with the loading of an unsigned or mismatched DLL (`SentinelAgentCore.dll`).\n*   **User Training:** Train users to be suspicious of any instructions from a website or email that ask them to copy and run commands in the Run dialog, command prompt, or PowerShell.\n*   **Threat Hunting:** Hunt for legitimate executables running from non-standard paths, as this is a common indicator of side-loading attacks.\n\n---\n\n## Mitigation\n\n1.  **Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) Rules:** Implement Microsoft Defender ASR rules, specifically the rule that blocks executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criterion. This can prevent the malicious MSI from running.\n2.  **Application Control (D3-EAL: Executable Allowlisting):** Use technologies like AppLocker or Windows Defender Application Control to prevent unauthorized executables and DLLs from running. A properly configured policy would block the malicious `SentinelAgentCore.dll` from being loaded.\n3.  **Email and Web Filtering:** Block known malicious domains at the web proxy and DNS levels. Enhanced email filtering can prevent the initial phishing lure from reaching the user.\n4.  **User Education:** The \"ClickFix\" technique relies entirely on tricking the user. Ongoing security awareness training is a critical layer of defense against this social engineering vector.",

A properly configured policy would prevent the core of this attack. The policy should be configured to only allow signed binaries from trusted vendors to execute. More importantly, it should enforce that DLLs loaded by a process are also signed by the same trusted certificate. In this specific attack, while `SentinelAgentWorker.exe` is legitimately signed by SentinelOne, the malicious `SentinelAgentCore.dll` is not. An effective application control policy would block the signed executable from loading the unsigned, malicious DLL, thus breaking the attack chain at the defense evasion stage. This moves security from a reactive detection model to a proactive prevention model.",

      "recommendation": "Given Storm-0249's reliance on fileless PowerShell, comprehensive PowerShell logging and analysis is a critical detection strategy. Organizations must enable PowerShell Script Block Logging (Event ID 4104) and Transcription Logging via Group Policy. This ensures that the full content of every PowerShell script executed on an endpoint is logged, even if it's downloaded and run entirely in memory, as seen with the `curl | powershell` technique. These logs should be forwarded to a SIEM, where analysts can create detection rules to hunt for suspicious activity. Rules should look for obfuscated commands, use of `Invoke-Expression` or `IEX`, network connection cmdlets, and scripts that attempt to interact with the registry or file system in unusual ways. This visibility into PowerShell activity is essential for de-obfuscating and understanding the attacker's actions during the initial execution phase.",
