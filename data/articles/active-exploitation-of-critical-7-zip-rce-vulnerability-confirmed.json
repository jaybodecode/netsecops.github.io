  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nA critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, **[CVE-2025-11001](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-11001)**, in the widely-used **7-Zip** file archiving utility is now under active exploitation. The vulnerability, first disclosed in October 2025, has a CVSS score of 7.0 and affects all versions of **7-Zip** prior to 25.0.0. The flaw is a path traversal weakness that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by tricking a user into extracting a malicious ZIP archive. Due to the ubiquity of **7-Zip** in both personal and enterprise environments, the potential for widespread compromise is significant. NHS England Digital has confirmed active exploitation and issued an advisory on November 18, 2025, urging immediate patching.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n**CVE-2025-11001** is a path traversal (also known as \"Zip Slip\") vulnerability. It stems from the improper handling of symbolic links within a ZIP archive. An attacker can create a malicious archive containing a symbolic link that points to a location outside of the intended extraction directory (e.g., `../../../../../../windows/system32/`). When a vulnerable version of **7-Zip** extracts this archive, it follows the symbolic link and writes a subsequent file (e.g., a malicious DLL or executable) to that sensitive system location. This can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running **7-Zip**.\n\nA related flaw, `CVE-2025-11002`, which shares the same root cause, is also fixed in the patched version.\n\n### Affected Systems\n- **7-Zip**: All versions prior to 25.0.0.\n\n### Exploitation Status\n- **Active Exploitation**: Confirmed in the wild. Attacks have been observed targeting the healthcare and finance sectors.\n- **Attack Vector**: Social engineering. Attackers trick users into downloading and extracting a malicious ZIP file, often delivered via phishing emails.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nSuccessful exploitation of **CVE-2025-11001** allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the victim's machine. This can be a stepping stone for a more comprehensive attack, including:\n- **Ransomware Deployment**: The attacker can drop and execute a ransomware payload.\n- **Credential Theft**: A malicious payload can be used to steal passwords, session cookies, and other sensitive data.\n- **Persistent Access**: The attacker can plant a backdoor or RAT (Remote Access Trojan) for long-term access to the compromised system and network.\n\nBecause **7-Zip** is often used in automated processes on servers, the vulnerability could also be triggered without direct user interaction if a server-side application automatically extracts untrusted archives. In this scenario, the code would execute with the privileges of the server's service account, which could be highly privileged.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n- **File Name**: Look for the extraction of ZIP files from untrusted sources, such as email attachments.\n- **Process Name**: Monitor for the `7z.exe` or `7zG.exe` process writing files to unexpected locations outside of the user's intended extraction folder (e.g., `C:\\Windows`, `C:\\Program Files`).\n- **Log Source**: EDR logs, File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) logs, and antivirus logs.\n\n## Detection Methods\n1.  **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**: Configure EDR rules to alert when the **7-Zip** process writes files to sensitive system directories. This is a high-fidelity indicator of exploitation.\n2.  **Asset Inventory**: Use system management tools or asset inventory scanners to identify all systems with vulnerable versions of **7-Zip** installed (< 25.0.0).\n3.  **Email Security Gateway**: Filter and block emails containing suspicious ZIP attachments, especially from unknown senders.\n\n## Remediation Steps\n1.  **Update Immediately**: The primary remediation is to update all installations of **7-Zip** to version 25.0.0 or later. This should be treated as a high-priority patch. See [`M1051 - Update Software`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1051/).\n2.  **Automate Patching**: This incident highlights the risk of manually-patched software. Organizations should use automated patch management systems to ensure that common utilities like **7-Zip** are kept up-to-date across the entire enterprise.\n3.  **User Training**: Remind users not to open or extract attachments from untrusted or unsolicited emails. See [`M1017 - User Training`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1017/).\n4.  **Restrict Execution**: As a compensating control, consider using application control policies (e.g., AppLocker) to prevent users from running unapproved software, although this may be difficult to implement for a common utility like **7-Zip**.",
