  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\n**[Samsung](https://security.samsungmobile.com/)** has begun rolling out its November 2025 security maintenance release for its lineup of Galaxy devices. The update is a significant one, addressing a total of 45 security vulnerabilities. This includes critical and high-severity flaws patched by **[Google](https://www.google.com)** in the core **[Android](https://www.android.com/)** operating system, most notably the zero-click RCE **`CVE-2025-48593`**. The package also contains 9 patches for Samsung's own One UI software and 11 fixes for vulnerabilities in its Exynos processors. Given the severity of the patched vulnerabilities, it is crucial for all Galaxy users to install this update as soon as it becomes available to protect their devices from potential exploitation.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerabilities Addressed\nThe November 2025 update is a comprehensive package that combines fixes from Google's Android Security Bulletin with Samsung's own patches.\n\n### Google Android Patches\nThe update incorporates all patches from Google's November 2025 bulletin, which includes:\n*   **2 Critical Vulnerabilities:** This includes the zero-click RCE flaw **`CVE-2025-48593`** in the System component, which is the most severe issue addressed this month.\n*   **23 High-Severity Vulnerabilities:** These address a range of issues, including elevation of privilege and information disclosure flaws.\n\n### Samsung Vulnerabilities and Exposures (SVEs)\nSamsung has patched 9 vulnerabilities specific to its software, including:\n*   **`CVE-2025-21071` (SVE-2024-1836):** A high-severity out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the fingerprint trustlet, affecting Android versions 13 through 16.\n*   **`CVE-2025-21074` (SVE-2025-1898):** An out-of-bounds read in the `libimagecodec.quram.so` library.\n\n### Exynos Chipset Patches\nThe update also includes 11 security fixes for vulnerabilities discovered in Samsung's proprietary Exynos processors, further hardening the hardware foundation of many Galaxy devices.\n\n## Affected Products\nThis security maintenance release is applicable to a wide range of Samsung Galaxy devices, including smartphones and tablets, that are currently supported by the company's update policy. The specific models and rollout timing will vary by region and carrier. This includes devices running:\n*   Android 13\n*   Android 14\n*   Android 15\n*   Android 16\n\n## Impact Assessment\nApplying this update is critical for user security. Failure to patch could leave devices vulnerable to a range of attacks:\n*   **Remote Compromise:** The unpatched **`CVE-2025-48593`** could allow an attacker to take full control of a device remotely without any user interaction.\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** Other high-severity flaws could allow a malicious application to gain system-level privileges, bypassing Android's security model to steal data or install persistent malware.\n*   **Data Leakage:** Vulnerabilities in components like the fingerprint trustlet could potentially lead to the compromise of sensitive biometric data.\n\n## Deployment Priority\nThis update should be considered **High Priority** for all users. Due to the presence of a critical, zero-click RCE vulnerability, the risk of exploitation is significant. Users should enable automatic updates or manually check for the update and install it immediately.\n\n## Installation Instructions\n1.  **Check for Updates:** On your Samsung Galaxy device, navigate to `Settings` > `Software update`.\n2.  **Download and Install:** Tap on `Download and install`. If the update is available for your device, it will begin downloading.\n3.  **Reboot:** The device will prompt you to reboot to complete the installation process.\n\n> It is recommended to be connected to a Wi-Fi network before downloading the update to avoid mobile data charges and to ensure your device has at least 50% battery life before starting the installation.\n\n## Cyber Observables\nTo verify remediation, check the device's security patch level.\n| Type | Value | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| other | Android Security Patch Level | After the update, the patch level should read `2025-11-01` or later. |\n| other | Samsung Knox Version | Check for updated versions of Samsung's security components. |",
