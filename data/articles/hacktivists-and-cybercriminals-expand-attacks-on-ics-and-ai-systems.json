  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nResearch published by **[Cyble](https://cyble.com/)** Research & Intelligence Labs (CRIL) on January 20, 2026, paints a concerning picture of the evolving threat landscape. The report reveals a significant trend where both politically motivated hacktivists and profit-driven cybercriminals are expanding their focus to include attacks on critical infrastructure and artificial intelligence systems. This convergence creates unprecedented challenges for defenders, as attackers are now blending traditional OT exploitation with sophisticated, AI-enhanced attack methods to increase their speed, scale, and complexity.\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe research identifies several key trends:\n- **ICS/OT Targeting:** Attackers are actively exploiting exposed Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. This poses a direct threat to critical infrastructure sectors like energy, manufacturing, and transportation.\n- **AI as a Target and a Tool:** Enterprise AI workflows are becoming a new attack surface. Adversaries are using techniques like prompt injection and data poisoning to manipulate AI systems. Simultaneously, they are using AI as a tool to automate and enhance their own attacks, developing polymorphic malware and highly convincing deepfake lures.\n- **Ransomware Evolution:** Ransomware remains the most disruptive threat, with some groups shifting to extortion-only models where they steal data but do not encrypt it.\n- **Threat Actor Growth:** The cybercrime ecosystem is expanding rapidly, with some adversary forums reportedly gaining around 10,000 new members each month since mid-2025.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThe report highlights a blend of old and new TTPs:\n- **ICS/OT Exploitation:** Attackers are scanning for and exploiting exposed HMIs and SCADA systems, which often lack modern security controls. This could involve exploiting known vulnerabilities ([`T0886 - Remote Services`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0886/)) or using default credentials ([`T0816 - Default Credentials`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0816/)) to gain access.\n- **AI Attack Vectors:**\n  - **Prompt Injection:** Manipulating the inputs to a large language model (LLM) to bypass its safety controls or cause it to execute unintended actions.\n  - **Data Poisoning:** Injecting malicious data into the training set of an AI model to corrupt its behavior.\n- **AI-Enhanced Attacks:**\n  - **Polymorphic Malware:** Using AI to automatically generate unique versions of malware for each target, making signature-based detection ineffective ([`T1027.006 - Reversible Encryption`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/006/)).\n  - **AI-Generated Lures:** Creating highly realistic deepfake audio or video for use in social engineering and business email compromise (BEC) attacks ([`T1566 - Phishing`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/)).\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe convergence of these threats creates a perfect storm. Attacks on ICS/OT can lead to physical disruption, environmental damage, and threats to public safety. The weaponization of AI accelerates the entire attack lifecycle, from reconnaissance to impact, overwhelming traditional security teams. An AI-powered attacker can conduct more sophisticated and personalized attacks at a scale that was previously impossible. This forces organizations to defend against faster, more adaptive, and harder-to-detect threats across both their digital and physical operations.\n\n## IOCs\nThis is a trend report and does not contain specific IOCs.\n\n## Detection & Response\n- **ICS/OT Monitoring**: Deploy network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) specifically designed for OT environments that can understand industrial protocols (e.g., Modbus, DNP3) and alert on anomalous commands or traffic.\n- **AI Security Posture Management**: Implement tools to monitor AI models for signs of data poisoning, model drift, or adversarial attacks. Log and analyze all prompts and outputs from enterprise LLMs to detect potential injection attacks.\n- **D3FEND: Network Traffic Analysis ([`D3-NTA`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkTrafficAnalysis))**: Enhance network monitoring to detect the sophisticated, adaptive C2 traffic that may be generated by AI-powered malware.\n\n## Mitigation\n- **ICS/OT Security Fundamentals**: Isolate OT networks from IT networks using a properly configured firewall or data diode. Remove any direct internet connectivity for HMIs and SCADA systems.\n- **AI Governance**: Establish a strong AI governance framework that includes security reviews for all new AI projects. Implement strict access controls for training data and production models.\n- **Assume Breach in AI**: Treat AI models as a potential attack surface. Implement input validation and sanitization for all prompts and outputs to and from LLMs to mitigate prompt injection.\n- **Security Awareness**: Update user training to include the threat of AI-generated deepfakes and sophisticated phishing lures. Emphasize out-of-band verification for any unusual or urgent financial requests.",

Implement a defensible architecture based on the Purdue Model, using firewalls and ideally a data diode to create a strong boundary between the IT and OT networks. All internet access from the OT network should be blocked by default. Any required data transfer between IT and OT should be done via a secure, monitored DMZ. This prevents attackers who compromise the IT network from pivoting to disrupt physical processes, directly mitigating the threat of attacks on HMI and SCADA systems.",

Implement robust input sanitization and filtering for any prompts sent to internal or external LLMs. This should include stripping out control characters, filtering for known prompt injection keywords (e.g., 'ignore previous instructions'), and enforcing strict length and format limits. This acts as an application-layer firewall for your AI, preventing attackers from manipulating its behavior through malicious inputs.",
