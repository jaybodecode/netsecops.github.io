  "summary": "The CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) has issued a warning about a critical vulnerability, CVE-2026-1245, in the popular 'binary-parser' npm library for Node.js. The flaw, which has a CVSS score of 6.5, allows for arbitrary JavaScript execution. The vulnerability exists because the library dynamically generates parser code from user-supplied input without proper sanitization, creating a code injection sink. This poses a significant software supply chain risk, as any application using the library to parse untrusted data could be compromised. Developers are urged to update to the patched version 2.3.0 immediately.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nOn January 21, 2026, the **[CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC)](https://www.cert.org/)** issued an alert for **CVE-2026-1245**, a significant code execution vulnerability in 'binary-parser', a widely-used **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)** library for **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the Node.js process. The root cause is the library's failure to sanitize user input when dynamically generating parser code at runtime. This flaw represents a serious software supply chain risk, as it can be triggered in any application that uses 'binary-parser' to process data from an untrusted source. A patch has been released in version 2.3.0, and all developers using this library are advised to update immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n- **CVE ID:** **CVE-2026-1245**\n- **CVSS Score:** 6.5 (Medium)\n- **Affected Library:** `binary-parser` npm library versions prior to 2.3.0.\n- **Description:** The 'binary-parser' library improves performance by dynamically generating JavaScript source code for its parsers as a string and then compiling it using the `Function` constructor (`new Function(...)`). However, it fails to properly sanitize all user-supplied input that is incorporated into this dynamically generated code. An attacker who can control the input being parsed can inject malicious JavaScript code. This code is then executed by the `Function` constructor, leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified conceptual example\nvar userInput = '});require(\"child_process\").execSync(\"touch /tmp/pwned\");//';\nvar codeString = 'return new Parser().string(\"message\", { length: ' + userInput + ' });';\n\n// The library effectively does this, leading to code injection\nvar func = new Function('Parser', codeString);\n```\n\n## Affected Systems\nAny Node.js application that uses the 'binary-parser' npm library (versions before 2.3.0) to parse data from an untrusted source is vulnerable. This includes applications processing:\n- Network protocols\n- File formats\n- User-submitted data via APIs\n\n## Exploitation Status\nA proof-of-concept is publicly available. Given the popularity of the library, it is likely that threat actors will begin scanning for and exploiting this vulnerability in public-facing applications.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThis is a classic software supply chain vulnerability. A single flaw in a popular, low-level library can introduce a critical vulnerability into thousands of downstream applications. A successful exploit of **CVE-2026-1245** allows an attacker to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server running the Node.js application. This could lead to a complete server compromise, data theft, lateral movement within the network, and deployment of further malware.\n\n## Detection Methods\n1.  **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** The most effective way to detect this vulnerability is to use an SCA tool to scan your projects' dependencies. These tools can identify if you are using a vulnerable version of the `binary-parser` library.\n2.  **Code Review:** Manually inspect `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files for the presence of `binary-parser` and check its version.\n3.  **Dynamic Analysis:** In a testing environment, use fuzzing techniques to supply malformed input to parts of your application that use the library to see if you can trigger unexpected behavior, though this is less reliable than SCA.\n\n## Remediation Steps\n1.  **Update the Library:** The only remediation is to update the `binary-parser` library to the patched version **2.3.0** or later. This can be done by running the following command in your project directory:\n    ```bash\n    npm install binary-parser@latest\n    ```\n    Or, if using yarn:\n    ```bash\n    yarn upgrade binary-parser --latest\n    ```\n    This action directly corresponds to **MITRE ATT&CK Mitigation** [`M1051 - Update Software`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1051/).\n2.  **Validate Dependencies:** After updating, delete your `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again to ensure a clean installation of the patched dependency tree.\n3.  **Input Sanitization:** As a general best practice, always treat data from external sources as untrusted and sanitize it before processing, even when using libraries that are believed to be secure.",

Use your package manager to upgrade to version 2.3.0 or higher across all projects.

After updating the dependency in `package.json`, it is crucial to delete the `package-lock.json` file and the `node_modules` directory, then run a fresh `npm install` or `yarn` to ensure that the patched version is pulled in and no vulnerable sub-dependencies remain.",
