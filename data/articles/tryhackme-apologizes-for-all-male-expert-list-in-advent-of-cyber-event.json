  "summary": "Cybersecurity training platform TryHackMe issued a public apology on November 28, 2025, after announcing an all-male list of 18 industry helpers for its popular \"Advent of Cyber\" event. The omission sparked significant backlash from the cybersecurity community regarding the lack of gender diversity and representation. The company acknowledged the mistake was unintentional, stating several female creators had been invited but were unavailable.

  "full_report": "## Incident Summary\nOn November 28, 2025, the cybersecurity training platform **[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)** faced a public relations crisis after it announced the lineup of industry professionals and influencers who would be assisting students during its annual \"Advent of Cyber\" challenge. The list of 18 helpers was composed entirely of men, leading to immediate and widespread criticism from the information security community on social media platforms. Critics pointed to the announcement as a stark example of the ongoing lack of female representation and visibility in the cybersecurity industry.\n\n## Community Reaction\nThe backlash was swift, with many cybersecurity professionals, both male and female, expressing disappointment. The conversation highlighted concerns that all-male panels and expert lists perpetuate the exclusion of women and discourage newcomers. The incident ignited a broader debate about diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within the cybersecurity field, with discussions touching on sexism, ageism, and the role of influencer culture in shaping industry perceptions.\n\n## Company Response\nTryHackMe responded quickly to the criticism, issuing a public apology and acknowledging the oversight. A company spokesperson stated that the omission was unintentional and provided context that they had reached out to several female content creators who were either unable to participate due to prior commitments or did not respond. Ethical hacker Katie Paxton-Fear publicly confirmed she was one of the women who had been invited but was unavailable.\n\n> \"We recognise we should have communicated this context better,\" a TryHackMe spokesperson admitted.\n\nIn a move to rectify the situation, TryHackMe announced it was collaborating with Eva Benn, a principal security program manager at **[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/security)**, to actively recruit and onboard a group of female creators to the helper panel before the event begins.\n\n## Broader Implications\nThis incident serves as a case study in the importance of diversity and representation in the tech industry. While not a technical security breach, it represents a breach of trust with a community that is actively working to become more inclusive. The event underscores that for an organization to be a leader in the cybersecurity space, its responsibilities extend beyond technical training to fostering a welcoming and representative environment. The quick and corrective response from TryHackMe, while reactive, demonstrates a willingness to listen to community feedback and take tangible steps toward improvement.",
