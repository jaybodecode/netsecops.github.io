  "title": "Everest Ransomware Group Alleges Major Breach at Nissan, Claims 900 GB of Corporate Data Exfiltrated",
  "summary": "The Everest ransomware group has claimed a massive data breach against Japanese automotive giant Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. In a post on its dark web leak site on January 10, 2026, the group alleged it had stolen approximately 900 GB of sensitive corporate data. To back up its claim, Everest published screenshots showing internal directory structures and file names related to dealerships, finance, and audits. The group, which employs a double-extortion model, has given Nissan a five-day deadline to respond before it threatens to release the data publicly. Nissan has not yet officially confirmed the breach.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nThe **[Everest](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/everest)** cybercrime group has publicly claimed responsibility for a major cyberattack on the Japanese automaker **[Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.](https://www.nissan-global.com/)**. The claim, posted on the group's dark web leak site on January 10, 2026, states that approximately 900 GB of sensitive data was exfiltrated from Nissan's network. The group provided screenshots as purported evidence, showing file and directory names that suggest the compromised data includes dealership information, financial records, and audit reports. Operating a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model, Everest is using this claim to extort Nissan, threatening to leak the data within five days if their demands are not met. The incident, while unconfirmed by Nissan, highlights the persistent threat of double-extortion ransomware to major global corporations in the manufacturing sector.\n\n## Threat Overview\nEverest is a known ransomware group that engages in double extortion. Their primary motivation is financial gain. The attack on Nissan follows a typical pattern for such groups: infiltrate the network, move laterally to gain access to valuable data, exfiltrate the data, and then, in many cases, deploy ransomware to encrypt systems. The public claim on their leak site is a key part of their playbook, designed to pressure the victim into paying the ransom by creating reputational damage and the threat of releasing sensitive business information. The 900 GB data volume, if accurate, represents a massive compromise of corporate intelligence.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThe screenshots provided by Everest suggest they gained deep access into Nissan's corporate network. The file names (`.csv`, `.xls`, `.txt`) and directory structures (`dealership`, `finance`, `audit`) indicate access to structured and unstructured data from core business functions. The attack likely involved the following TTPs:\n1.  **Initial Access:** Ransomware groups like Everest often gain initial access through phishing, exploitation of unpatched public-facing services (like VPNs or RDP), or by purchasing access from initial access brokers.\n2.  **Privilege Escalation & Lateral Movement:** Once inside, the attackers would have used techniques like credential dumping ([`T1003`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/)) and remote services ([`T1021`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/)) to escalate privileges and move across the network to file servers and databases.\n3.  **Discovery & Collection:** The attackers performed extensive discovery to locate valuable data. The specific nature of the folder names shown in the screenshots indicates a targeted effort to find financial and operational data ([`T1602 - Data from Information Repositories`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1602/)).\n4.  **Exfiltration:** The 900 GB of data would have been compressed and exfiltrated over a period of time to attacker-controlled infrastructure, likely using encrypted protocols to avoid detection ([`T1567 - Exfiltration Over Web Service`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/)).\n5.  **Impact:** While not yet confirmed, the final stage would typically be the deployment of Everest ransomware to encrypt Nissan's systems ([`T1486 - Data Encrypted for Impact`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/)).\n\n## Impact Assessment\nIf the claim is legitimate, the impact on Nissan would be substantial:\n- **Financial Loss:** A large ransom payment, combined with the costs of incident response, system restoration, and legal fees, would be financially damaging.\n- **Business Disruption:** Widespread encryption would halt manufacturing, sales, and administrative operations, leading to significant revenue loss.\n- **Intellectual Property Theft:** The stolen data could include proprietary vehicle designs, manufacturing processes, and future business strategies, which would be highly valuable to competitors.\n- **Regulatory Scrutiny:** As a global company, Nissan would face investigation and potential fines from data protection authorities worldwide.\n- **Reputational Damage:** The breach would damage trust among customers, partners, and investors, especially following a separate breach the company disclosed in December 2025.\n\n## Detection & Response\nDetecting such an attack before the final encryption stage is critical.\n\n### Detection Strategies\n- **Monitor for Data Staging:** Use EDR and FIM tools to detect the creation of large archive files on critical servers, which is a tell-tale sign of data being prepared for exfiltration.\n- **Egress Traffic Monitoring:** Implement strict egress filtering and monitor for unusually large outbound data transfers, especially to destinations not on an allowlist. A 900 GB transfer should trigger multiple alerts.\n- **Active Directory Monitoring:** Monitor for anomalous Active Directory activity, such as the creation of new admin accounts, password spraying, or Kerberoasting attacks, which are common precursors to ransomware deployment.\n\n## Mitigation\nDefending against groups like Everest requires a defense-in-depth strategy.\n\n### Immediate Actions\n1.  **Patch Public-Facing Systems:** Ensure all internet-facing systems, including VPNs and firewalls, are fully patched and securely configured. This is a key part of [`M1051 - Update Software`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1051/).\n2.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA on all remote access services and for all privileged accounts to prevent credential-based attacks. This aligns with [`M1032 - Multi-factor Authentication`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1032/).\n\n### Strategic Recommendations\n- **Immutable Backups:** Maintain logically and physically isolated backups of all critical systems. The '3-2-1' rule (3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite) is essential.\n- **Network Segmentation:** Segment the network to limit an attacker's ability to move laterally. Critical manufacturing and R&D networks should be isolated from the general corporate IT network ([`M1030 - Network Segmentation`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1030/)).\n- **Incident Response Plan:** Have a well-defined and regularly tested incident response plan that includes playbooks specifically for ransomware attacks.",

This involves using NetFlow, Zeek, or full packet capture to baseline normal traffic patterns and volumes. A rule should be configured to trigger a high-severity alert for any single session or cumulative transfer from the internal network to an external destination that exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 10 GB in an hour). Such a massive transfer is a definitive indicator of a major data theft in progress. Early detection through this method could allow the security team to block the connection and begin incident response before the full dataset is stolen, significantly reducing the leverage of the Everest group.",

An alert on a process like `7z.exe` creating a multi-gigabyte archive on a finance server is a high-confidence indicator of compromise, allowing security teams to intervene before the data leaves the network.",
