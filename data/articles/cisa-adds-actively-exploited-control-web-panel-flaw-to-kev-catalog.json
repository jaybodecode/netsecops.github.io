  "summary": "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a critical command injection vulnerability in Control Web Panel (CWP), CVE-2025-48703, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. The action confirms the flaw is being actively exploited in the wild. The vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on servers running the popular Linux web hosting panel. CISA has mandated that all Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies patch the vulnerability by November 25, 2025, and strongly urges all other organizations to remediate it immediately.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nOn November 5, 2025, the **[U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov)** added **[CVE-2025-48703](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48703)**, a critical OS command injection vulnerability in **Control Web Panel (CWP)**, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. This action serves as a definitive warning that the vulnerability is under active attack by threat actors. The flaw, which can lead to unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE), affects a widely used free Linux web hosting management panel, putting countless servers at risk of complete compromise. In response, CISA has set a deadline of November 25, 2025, for U.S. federal agencies to apply patches. All other organizations using CWP are strongly advised to prioritize remediation immediately to prevent system takeover.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n**CVE-2025-48703** is an OS command injection vulnerability in Control Web Panel (formerly CentOS Web Panel). It allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user.\n\nThe flaw exists in the file manager's `changePerm` endpoint. An attacker can inject shell metacharacters into the `t_total` parameter of an HTTPS POST request sent to this endpoint. While the endpoint requires authentication, researchers found that the authentication check could be bypassed if the attacker knows or can guess a valid, non-root username on the CWP instance. Since usernames like `admin` or the server's domain name are common, this prerequisite is often easy to meet.\n\nExample of a malicious request body:\n```json\n{\n  \"t_total\": \"';/usr/bin/id > /usr/local/cwpsrv/htdocs/resources/admin/modules/file_manager/test.txt;'\"\n}\n```\nThis would execute the `id` command and write the output to a web-accessible file, confirming the RCE.\n\n## Affected Systems\n-   **Control Web Panel (CWP)** versions prior to `0.9.8.1205`.\n\nThe patch was released in June 2025, but any server that has not been updated since then remains vulnerable.\n\n## Exploitation Status\n**This vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild.** CISA's addition of CVE-2025-48703 to the KEV catalog is based on concrete evidence of ongoing attacks. Threat actors are likely scanning the internet for vulnerable CWP instances to compromise them for use in botnets, crypto-mining operations, or as launch points for other attacks.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a complete compromise of the web server. An attacker can:\n-   **Host Malicious Content**: Deface websites, host phishing pages, or distribute malware.\n-   **Steal Data**: Access and exfiltrate all data from the websites hosted on the server, including databases and user credentials.\n-   **Gain a Foothold**: Use the compromised server as a pivot point to attack other systems within the internal network.\n-   **System Resource Abuse**: Install crypto-miners or add the server to a botnet for DDoS attacks.\n\nFor web hosting providers, a single compromised CWP instance could lead to the breach of hundreds or thousands of their customers' websites.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n| Type | Value | Description | Context | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| url_pattern | `/usr/local/cwpsrv/htdocs/resources/admin/modules/file_manager/` | The path to the vulnerable `changePerm` endpoint. | Monitor web server access logs for POST requests to this specific path. | high |\n| command_line_pattern | `t_total` parameter with shell metacharacters | The `t_total` parameter in a POST request body containing characters like `;`, `|`, `&`, or `` ` ``. | Inspect the body of POST requests in WAF logs or network traffic captures. | high |\n| file_name | Unexpected files appearing in web-accessible directories. | A common post-exploitation step is to write a file to confirm RCE or to drop a web shell. | Use File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) on web root directories. | medium |\n\n## Detection Methods\n1.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Implement a WAF rule to inspect POST requests to the CWP file manager endpoint and block any that contain shell metacharacters in the `t_total` parameter. This is a form of **[D3-ITF: Inbound Traffic Filtering](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:InboundTrafficFiltering)**.\n2.  **Log Analysis**: Ingest CWP access logs into a SIEM and create alerts for POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint, especially if they originate from unusual IP addresses or occur in high frequency.\n3.  **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regularly scan public-facing assets with a vulnerability scanner to identify any servers running a vulnerable version of CWP.\n\n## Remediation Steps\n1.  **Update CWP**: The only definitive solution is to update CWP to version `0.9.8.1205` or later. CWP typically has an auto-update feature, but administrators should manually verify that the update has been applied. This is a direct application of **[D3-SU: Software Update](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SoftwareUpdate)**.\n2.  **Restrict Access**: If immediate patching is not possible, restrict access to the CWP admin portal (typically on port 2031) to only trusted IP addresses via firewall rules. This significantly reduces the attack surface.\n3.  **Post-Update Hardening**: After updating, review all user accounts on the CWP instance and remove any that are unnecessary. Enforce strong, unique passwords for all remaining accounts.",

This should be treated as an emergency change. Before updating, it is prudent to take a snapshot or backup of the server. The update can typically be initiated from the CWP dashboard or via a command-line script provided by CWP. After the update is complete, administrators must verify that the new version is active and that all hosted websites are functioning correctly.

A custom WAF rule should be created to inspect the body of all POST requests sent to the CWP server. The rule should specifically look for the parameter `t_total` and check its value for common shell metacharacters such as semicolons (;), pipes (|), ampersands (&), and backticks (`). If these characters are detected within the `t_total` parameter's value, the request should be blocked, and a high-priority alert should be generated. This provides a strong virtual patch that can protect the server even before the CWP software itself has been updated, and it offers continued protection against similar injection-style attacks in the future.",
