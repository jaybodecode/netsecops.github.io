On January 20, 2026, a regional update server was compromised, causing it to push a malicious file named 'Reload.exe' to enterprise and consumer customers.

  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nOn January 20, 2026, Indian cybersecurity firm **[MicroWorld Technologies](https://www.escanav.com/)** suffered a supply chain attack impacting its **eScan** antivirus product line. An attacker gained unauthorized access to a regional update server and replaced a legitimate update file with a malicious payload. This resulted in eScan customers receiving and executing malware disguised as a legitimate update. The security firm Morphisec, which discovered the attack, reported that the malware, named `Reload.exe`, first disables the host's ability to receive further updates by modifying the `HOSTS` file. It then establishes persistence and downloads additional malware. MicroWorld has acknowledged the incident but disputes the characterization, creating a public disagreement over the nature of the breach. Due to the tampering, automatic remediation is not possible, requiring manual intervention from affected users.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\nThis incident is a classic example of a **[supply chain attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack)**, where a trusted vendor's infrastructure is compromised to distribute malware to its customers. By compromising the update mechanism of a security product, the attackers turned a tool of defense into a vector for infection.\n\n**Attack Vector**: The attackers compromised one of eScan's regional update servers. They replaced a legitimate update file with a malicious executable, `Reload.exe`. When eScan clients performed a routine update check, they downloaded and executed this malicious file, believing it to be a trusted part of the antivirus software.\n\n### Malware Analysis: Reload.exe\nThe infection chain is designed for stealth and persistence:\n1.  **Execution**: The `Reload.exe` file is executed on the victim's machine with system privileges, as it is launched by the antivirus software itself.\n2.  **Defense Evasion**: The malware's first action is to modify the local `HOSTS` file (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts`). It adds entries that redirect eScan's update domains to a non-routable IP address (e.g., `127.0.0.1`). This prevents the compromised machine from contacting the legitimate update servers, effectively freezing the antivirus definitions and blocking any potential cleanup updates from the vendor.\n3.  **Persistence**: The malware establishes persistence by creating scheduled tasks that ensure it runs automatically upon system startup or at regular intervals.\n4.  **Payload Delivery**: Once entrenched, the malware contacts an attacker-controlled command-and-control (C2) server to download and execute additional malicious payloads. The nature of these secondary payloads has not been disclosed but could range from spyware and credential stealers to ransomware.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThe TTPs observed in this attack are indicative of a well-planned operation:\n- [`T1195.002 - Compromise Software Supply Chain`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/002/): The core of the attack, where the attackers compromised the vendor's update infrastructure to distribute malware.\n- [`T1574.002 - Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/): While not explicitly DLL side-loading, the principle of replacing a legitimate executable with a malicious one is similar.\n- [`T1562.001 - Disable or Modify Tools`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001/): The malware actively disables the security software that is meant to protect the system.\n- [`T1053.005 - Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005/): Used to establish a persistent foothold on the compromised system.\n- [`T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105/): The malware downloads further payloads from a C2 server.\n\n## Impact Assessment\n- **Erosion of Trust**: A supply chain attack on a security vendor is particularly damaging as it undermines the trust between the vendor and its customers. Users rely on these products for protection, and when they become the source of infection, it creates a significant crisis of confidence.\n- **Widespread Compromise**: The attack potentially affects the entire eScan user base that received the malicious update, including both enterprise and consumer clients globally.\n- **Difficult Remediation**: Because the malware blocks the update mechanism, automated fixes cannot be pushed. Each affected machine must be cleaned manually, a time-consuming and costly process for enterprise customers.\n- **Data Breach Potential**: The secondary payloads delivered by the initial malware could lead to widespread data breaches, credential theft, and ransomware incidents across the affected user base.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n| Type | Value | Description | Context | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| `file_name` | `Reload.exe` | The name of the malicious executable distributed by the compromised update server. | EDR logs, file system analysis | high |\n| `file_path` | `C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts` | The HOSTS file is modified by the malware. Monitor for unexpected changes. | File integrity monitoring (FIM) | high |\n| `string_pattern` | `update.escanav.com` | The malware adds entries for eScan domains to the HOSTS file. Look for these domains being redirected. | HOSTS file content analysis | high |\n| `process_name` | `Reload.exe` | The process name of the malware. | EDR process monitoring | high |\n| `event_id` | `4657` | A registry value was modified. The malware may modify registry keys for persistence or configuration. | Windows Security Event Log | medium |\n\n## Detection & Response\n- **Detect**: Use File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) to alert on any modifications to the `HOSTS` file. Monitor for the creation of new scheduled tasks, especially those pointing to unfamiliar executables. EDR solutions should be configured to alert on processes that modify critical system files or attempt to disable other security tools.\n- **Response**: If a compromise is suspected, immediately isolate the affected machine. Manually inspect the `HOSTS` file for entries related to eScan or MicroWorld. Do not rely on the installed eScan product for remediation. Contact eScan support to obtain their manual cleaning utility. Conduct a full forensic analysis to determine what secondary payloads may have been installed.\n\n## Mitigation\n- **Defense in Depth**: Do not rely on a single security product. A layered security approach with EDR, network monitoring, and application control can provide overlapping coverage and may detect or prevent secondary payloads even if the primary AV is compromised.\n- **Application Whitelisting**: Implement application control policies that only allow known, trusted executables to run. This could prevent `Reload.exe` or its subsequent payloads from executing. ([`M1038 - Execution Prevention`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1038/))\n- **Vendor Risk Management**: This incident highlights the importance of robust vendor risk management programs. Organizations should scrutinize the security practices of their critical software suppliers.\n- **Egress Filtering**: Implement strict egress filtering rules on firewalls to block outbound connections from endpoints to unknown or uncategorized domains, which can prevent malware from contacting its C2 server.
