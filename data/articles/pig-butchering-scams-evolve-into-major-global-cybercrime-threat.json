  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nA new threat intelligence report from **[CYFIRMA](https://www.cyfirma.com/)**, along with public warnings from the **[FBI](https://www.fbi.gov)**, highlights the alarming rise of \"Pig Butchering\" scams as a major global cybercrime threat. This form of fraud, known as *Sha Zhu Pan* in Chinese, is a highly organized and psychologically manipulative long-con. Scammers build deep, often romantic, relationships with their victims over an extended period before convincing them to invest in fraudulent cryptocurrency or foreign exchange platforms. The combination of emotional grooming and sophisticated fake trading apps leads to devastating financial losses for victims, making it one of the most destructive forms of online fraud.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\nPig butchering is a multi-stage social engineering attack that blends investment fraud with romance scams. The name comes from the concept of \"fattening the pig\" (the victim) with trust and small, fake investment returns before the \"slaughter\" (stealing the entire investment).\n\n**The Scam Lifecycle:**\n1.  **The Hook:** Scammers make contact through unsolicited messages on social media (LinkedIn, Instagram), dating apps (Tinder, Hinge), or even a seemingly accidental text message.\n2.  **Grooming:** The scammer spends weeks or months building a deep personal or romantic relationship with the victim. They share personal stories, offer advice, and build a strong foundation of trust.\n3.  **The Pitch:** Once trust is established, the scammer introduces a \"secret\" or \"exclusive\" investment opportunity, usually in cryptocurrency, claiming to have an inside source or a foolproof strategy. They portray themselves as a successful investor.\n4.  **The Fake Platform:** The victim is directed to a professionally designed but completely fraudulent trading website or mobile app, which is controlled by the scammer. The platform shows realistic charts and account balances.\n5.  **Fattening the Pig:** The victim is encouraged to start with a small investment. The fake platform shows impressive gains, and the scammer may even allow a small, successful withdrawal to further build confidence.\n6.  **The Slaughter:** Convinced of the opportunity's legitimacy, the victim invests a large sum of money. When they attempt to withdraw their funds, they are hit with fake excuses (taxes, fees, account verification charges) or the platform is simply shut down, and the scammer disappears.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nWhile the core of the attack is social engineering, it is supported by a sophisticated technical infrastructure.\n- [`T1566 - Phishing`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/): The initial contact is a form of phishing, designed to engage the victim.\n- **Fraudulent Infrastructure:** Scammers operate a network of convincing but fake websites and mobile applications. These apps are sometimes even snuck onto official app stores or distributed via enterprise provisioning profiles on iOS.\n- **Money Laundering:** The stolen funds, typically in cryptocurrency, are quickly moved through a complex chain of wallets and mixers to obscure their origin, making recovery nearly impossible.\n- [`T1583 - Acquire Infrastructure`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/): The criminal organizations behind these scams acquire domain names, SSL certificates, and hosting to build their fake platforms.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe impact on victims is catastrophic and multi-faceted:\n- **Devastating Financial Loss:** Victims often lose their life savings, retirement funds, or even take out large loans to \"invest.\"\n- **Severe Psychological Trauma:** The betrayal of trust from a perceived romantic partner or close friend leads to severe emotional distress, shame, and depression.\n- **Organized Crime:** These scams are often run by large, organized criminal syndicates based in Southeast Asia, which frequently use victims of human trafficking as the operators conducting the scams.\n\n## IOCs\nIOCs for these scams are typically domain names of fraudulent trading platforms, which are constantly changing. The most effective indicators are behavioral.\n\n## Detection & Response\n**Detection (Red Flags for Individuals):**\n1.  An unsolicited contact from a stranger on a social media or dating platform who quickly tries to move the conversation to an encrypted app like WhatsApp or Telegram.\n2.  The person claims to be a highly successful investor and is eager to share their secrets with you.\n3.  They pressure you to invest in a cryptocurrency platform that is not a well-known, regulated exchange (e.g., Coinbase, Binance, Kraken).\n4.  The investment promises are unrealistic (e.g., guaranteed high returns with no risk).\n5.  You are asked to pay taxes or fees to withdraw your own money.\n\n**Response:**\n- If you suspect you are a victim, immediately cease all contact with the scammer and do not send any more money. Report the incident to law enforcement (such as the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center - IC3) and the platform where you met the scammer.\n\n## Mitigation\nPrevention is based on awareness and skepticism.\n- **Be Wary of Unsolicited Contact:** Treat any unsolicited message from a stranger with extreme caution, especially if it quickly turns to discussions of money or investing.\n- **Keep Finances and Romance Separate:** Never send money or invest on the advice of someone you have only met online.\n- **Use Reputable Platforms:** Only use well-known and regulated cryptocurrency exchanges and investment platforms. Be suspicious of any custom mobile app or website you are directed to.\n- **Verify, Don't Trust:** If an investment opportunity sounds too good to be true, it is. Search online for the name of the platform along with terms like \"scam\" or \"review.\"\n- **User Training:** Corporations should include warnings about pig butchering scams in their security awareness training, as employees may be targeted via professional networking sites like LinkedIn.",
