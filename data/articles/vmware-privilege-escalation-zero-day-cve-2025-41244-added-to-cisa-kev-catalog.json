  "summary": "CISA has added CVE-2025-41244, a high-severity local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerability in VMware products, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. The flaw affects VMware Aria Operations and VMware Tools and allows a non-administrative user on a virtual machine to gain root privileges. The vulnerability has been exploited as a zero-day since mid-October 2024, with attribution pointing to UNC5174, a suspected China-linked threat actor. The flaw is an untrusted search path vulnerability, and a public proof-of-concept is available, increasing the risk to unpatched systems.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\n\nThe U.S. **[Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov)** has added **`CVE-2025-41244`**, a high-severity local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerability affecting **[Broadcom's](https://www.broadcom.com/)** **[VMware](https://www.vmware.com/)** products, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. The flaw, rated CVSS 7.8, allows a local non-administrative user to escalate privileges to `root` on a virtual machine. The vulnerability has been actively exploited as a zero-day since at least mid-October 2024 by **UNC5174**, a threat actor suspected to have links to China. Given the active exploitation by a sophisticated threat actor and the public availability of a proof-of-concept (PoC), immediate patching is critical.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n\n**`CVE-2025-41244`** is an untrusted search path vulnerability. It exists within a shell script utilized by the Service Discovery Management Pack (SDMP) feature in **[VMware Aria Operations](https://www.vmware.com/products/aria-operations.html)** and **[VMware Tools](https://www.vmware.com/products/tools.html)**. The script uses overly broad regular expressions when searching for system binaries. An attacker with low-level privileges on a guest virtual machine can exploit this by placing a malicious executable in a world-writable directory, such as `/tmp/`.\n\nWhen the service discovery function is triggered, the vulnerable script may inadvertently execute the attacker's malicious binary instead of the legitimate system command. Because the script runs with high privileges, the attacker's code is executed as the `root` user, leading to a full privilege escalation.\n\n## Affected Systems\n\nThe vulnerability impacts multiple VMware products where the Service Discovery Management Pack (SDMP) is enabled:\n*   **VMware Aria Operations**\n*   **VMware Tools**\n*   **VMware Cloud Foundation**\n*   **VMware vSphere Foundation**\n\nAdministrators should consult the Broadcom security advisory for a full list of affected versions.\n\n## Exploitation Status\n\nThis vulnerability was exploited as a zero-day before a patch was available. According to researchers at **NVISO Labs**, who discovered and reported the flaw, the China-linked threat actor **UNC5174** has been exploiting it in the wild since mid-October 2024. Following the disclosure, NVISO researchers published a technical deep-dive and a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit. The combination of nation-state level exploitation and a public PoC significantly increases the risk for all organizations using vulnerable VMware products.\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\nAn attacker who successfully exploits **`CVE-2025-41244`** can escalate their privileges from a standard user to `root` within a virtual machine. This level of access allows the attacker to:\n*   Completely compromise the guest operating system.\n*   Disable security controls and install persistent backdoors.\n*   Access all sensitive data stored on the virtual machine.\n*   Potentially attempt to escape the VM to attack the underlying hypervisor (though this is a separate, more complex attack).\n*   Use the compromised VM as a staging ground for lateral movement within the network.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n\n*   **File Creation**: Monitor for the creation of executable files in world-writable directories like `/tmp/`, especially if their names mimic common system utilities (e.g., `df`, `ls`, `ps`).\n*   **Process Monitoring**: Look for the VMware service discovery process spawning unexpected child processes from directories like `/tmp/`.\n*   **Log Analysis**: Review logs from VMware tools and Aria Operations for errors or unusual activity related to the service discovery feature.\n\n## Detection Methods\n\n*   **EDR/Endpoint Security**: Deploy endpoint security solutions on VMs to detect and block suspicious process execution and file creation in common temporary directories. A rule that flags a process running from `/tmp` with `root` privileges would be effective. This is an example of [`D3-PA: Process Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ProcessAnalysis).\n*   **Vulnerability Management**: Scan all virtual machines for vulnerable versions of VMware Tools and Aria Operations agents.\n*   **Threat Hunting**: Proactively hunt for the PoC's artifacts. The public PoC creates a malicious binary in `/tmp/` and triggers its execution. Security teams can search for this specific behavior pattern across their VM fleet.\n\n## Remediation Steps\n\n1.  **Apply Patches**: The primary and most critical step is to apply the security patches released by Broadcom for all affected VMware products. This is a direct application of [`M1051 - Update Software`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1051/).\n2.  **Disable Service Discovery**: If patching is not immediately feasible, consider disabling the Service Discovery Management Pack (SDMP) feature as a temporary mitigation. However, this will result in a loss of functionality.\n3.  **Harden Systems**: Enforce security best practices on VMs, such as mounting `/tmp` with the `noexec` option to prevent the execution of binaries from that directory. This aligns with [`M1028 - Operating System Configuration`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1028/).\n4.  **Verify Patching**: After deployment, use vulnerability scanning tools to verify that the patches have been successfully applied and the vulnerability is remediated.",
