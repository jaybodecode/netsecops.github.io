  "summary": "The GlassWorm malware campaign has evolved, now specifically targeting macOS developers through malicious extensions for Visual Studio Code and OpenVSX. This new wave of attacks, detailed in a security digest from Acronis, uses a self-propagating worm to deliver its payload. The malware embeds an encrypted payload within JavaScript files, uses a 15-minute execution delay to evade sandboxes, and establishes persistence using LaunchAgents. The primary goal of GlassWorm is to steal a wide range of developer-centric data, including credentials for GitHub and npm, browser data, and information from over 50 different cryptocurrency wallets, highlighting a significant supply chain threat.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nA new variant of the **GlassWorm** malware is actively targeting developers using **[macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS)**. The campaign, highlighted by **[Acronis](https://www.acronis.com/)**, leverages malicious extensions for popular code editors **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** and **OpenVSX** to deliver its payload. This marks a strategic shift for the threat actor, who previously focused on Windows. The malware is a self-propagating worm designed for stealth and data theft. It uses encrypted payloads, delayed execution to bypass sandboxes, and `LaunchAgents` for persistence. Its primary objective is to steal sensitive developer credentials, including **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** and **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)** tokens, browser data, and cryptocurrency wallet information, posing a direct threat to both individual developers and the broader software supply chain.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\nGlassWorm is a multi-stage, data-stealing worm that has been active since at least October 2025. This fourth observed wave of activity demonstrates a clear pivot towards the Apple ecosystem and the developer community. By hiding within seemingly legitimate VS Code extensions, the malware abuses the trust developers place in the tools and marketplaces they use daily.\n\nThe attack vector is social engineering, tricking developers into installing a malicious extension from the VS Code Marketplace or OpenVSX registry. Once installed, the malware's lifecycle begins:\n\n1.  **Evasion:** The malicious JavaScript payload is AES-256-CBC encrypted and remains dormant for 15 minutes to evade automated analysis in sandbox environments.\n2.  **Execution:** After the delay, the malware uses AppleScript to execute its core logic.\n3.  **Persistence:** It establishes persistence on the infected Mac by creating a `LaunchAgent`, ensuring it runs automatically every time the user logs in.\n4.  **Theft:** The worm's primary function is to steal a wide array of sensitive data.\n\n---\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThe malware's TTPs are tailored for the macOS environment and developer targets.\n\n1.  **Initial Access (`T1195.001`):** The attack begins with the developer installing a compromised or malicious VS Code extension, a form of [`Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/001/).\n\n2.  **Defense Evasion (`T1497.003 - Time Based Evasion`):** The 15-minute sleep delay is a classic sandbox evasion technique. The payload is also encrypted to hinder static analysis ([`T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/)).\n\n3.  **Execution (`T1059.002 - AppleScript`):** The use of AppleScript for execution is a common technique for malware on macOS, as it is a built-in scripting language that can interact with the OS and other applications.\n\n4.  **Persistence (`T1543.001 - Launch Agent`):** By creating a `.plist` file in the `~/Library/LaunchAgents` directory, GlassWorm ensures it is automatically re-launched by the OS upon user login, a standard macOS persistence mechanism.\n\n5.  **Credential Access (`T1555.003 - Credentials from Web Browsers`):** The malware is specifically coded to find and exfiltrate credentials from browser databases, GitHub/npm configuration files, and over 50 types of cryptocurrency wallets.\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK Mapping\n| Tactic | Technique ID | Technique Name |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Initial Access | `T1195.001` | Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools |\n| Execution | `T1059.002` | AppleScript |\n| Persistence | `T1543.001` | Launch Agent |\n| Defense Evasion | `T1497.003` | Time Based Evasion |\n| Credential Access | `T1555.003` | Credentials from Web Browsers |\n| Collection | `T1560` | Archive Collected Data |\n\n---\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe impact of a successful GlassWorm infection is significant, particularly for the software supply chain:\n*   **Developer Credential Theft:** The theft of GitHub and npm credentials can allow attackers to push malicious code to legitimate software repositories, initiating a widespread supply chain attack.\n*   **Financial Theft:** By stealing cryptocurrency wallet data, attackers can directly drain funds from infected developers.\n*   **Corporate Espionage:** Stolen browser data and credentials can provide attackers with access to sensitive corporate systems, email, and internal documentation.\n*   **Further Compromise:** The stolen credentials can be used to pivot and launch further attacks against the developer's employer or collaborators.\n\n---\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\nHunting for GlassWorm involves looking for signs of its presence on macOS endpoints:\n\n| Type | Value | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| file_path | `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` | Look for recently created or suspicious `.plist` files in this directory. |\n| process_name | `osascript` | Monitor for `osascript` (the AppleScript execution engine) being launched by unusual parent processes, like VS Code. |\n| command_line_pattern | `*` | Analyze shell history for unusual commands executed by VS Code's integrated terminal. |\n| file_path | `~/.npmrc`, `~/.git-credentials` | Monitor for anomalous access to these credential files by unexpected processes. |\n\n---\n\n## Detection & Response\n*   **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** A macOS-aware EDR is essential for detection. It can monitor for the creation of new LaunchAgents, suspicious process chains (e.g., `Code -> osascript`), and unauthorized access to sensitive files like the SSH key folder or browser credential stores. This leverages **[Process Analysis (D3-PA)](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ProcessAnalysis)**.\n*   **Extension Vetting:** Before installing any VS Code extension, developers should vet it by checking the publisher's reputation, the number of installs, and user reviews. Avoid extensions from unknown or new publishers.\n*   **Log Analysis:** Centralize and analyze logs from developer endpoints. Look for outbound network connections from unexpected processes to identify potential C2 communication or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n## Mitigation\nSecuring developer endpoints is key to mitigating this threat.\n\n1.  **Limit Software Installation (M1033):** In corporate environments, consider creating an allowlist of approved VS Code extensions. This prevents developers from installing potentially malicious extensions from the public marketplace. This is a form of **[Executable Allowlisting (D3-EAL)](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ExecutableAllowlisting)** applied to extensions.\n\n2.  **Privileged Account Management (M1026):** Developers should not run as local administrators on their machines. This can limit the malware's ability to establish persistence or access system-level files.\n\n3.  **Credential Protection:** Encourage the use of hardware tokens (e.g., YubiKey) for Git commit signing and for accessing sensitive services. Avoid storing plaintext credentials or tokens in configuration files whenever possible. Use the macOS Keychain or other secure vaults to store secrets.\n\n4.  **Antivirus/Antimalware (M1049):** Use a reputable next-generation antivirus (NGAV) solution for macOS that can detect and block known malware like GlassWorm and identify suspicious behaviors.",

This can be enforced through policy settings within VS Code. Any attempt to install an extension not on this list would be blocked. This shifts from a reactive 'detect bad' model to a proactive 'only allow good' model, drastically reducing the attack surface presented by the developer's IDE.",

Security teams should create detection rules for anomalous process chains originating from VS Code.

Further rules can detect `osascript` or other processes attempting to write a `.plist` file to the `~/Library/LaunchAgents` directory. This behavioral approach is more resilient than signature-based detection and can catch the malware's core TTPs.",
