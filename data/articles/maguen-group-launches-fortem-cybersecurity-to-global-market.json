The launch signals a significant strategic pivot towards global expansion, with an explicit goal of entering the U.S. market soon.\n\n---\n\n## Company Overview\n**Maguen Group** is a well-established private security firm in Mexico with over 17 years of experience in physical and integrated security services. In 2019, the group acquired **MT Cyber**, a cybersecurity company founded in 2017, to build out its digital protection capabilities.\n\n**Fortem Cybersecurity** is the culmination of this integration, now positioned as a full-scale, global cybersecurity company. It will continue to provide the services of its predecessor, including:\n-   Cyber Threat Intelligence\n-   Managed Security Services (MSSP)\n-   Strategic Cybersecurity Consulting\n\n## Strategic Goals\nAccording to Zvi Michaeli, founder and CEO of Maguen Group, the launch of Fortem is a direct response to growing international demand for robust cybersecurity solutions. The brand's key strategic objectives are:\n1.  **Global Expansion:** Building on its current offices in Mexico, Ecuador, and Germany, Fortem is actively planning its entry into the United States market, followed by further global expansion.\n2.  **Democratization of Security:** Fortem aims to package and price its services to be accessible not just to large enterprises, but to companies of all sizes, breaking down the cost barriers to high-quality cyber defense.\n3.  **Integrated Security:** A core part of its value proposition is the integration of physical and digital security, leveraging Maguen Group's extensive experience in the private security sector. This holistic approach addresses threats that span both the physical and virtual worlds.\n\n## Market Position\nFortem Cybersecurity is positioning itself as a unique player in the crowded cybersecurity market by blending **Israeli technological expertise** with **Latin American innovation**. This suggests a focus on leveraging advanced, battle-tested security technologies, likely sourced from Israel's renowned cybersecurity ecosystem, while adapting them to the specific needs and challenges of the Latin American and broader global markets. By offering a proactive and integrated security model, Fortem aims to differentiate itself from traditional MSSPs and consulting firms, providing a more comprehensive security partnership to its clients.",
