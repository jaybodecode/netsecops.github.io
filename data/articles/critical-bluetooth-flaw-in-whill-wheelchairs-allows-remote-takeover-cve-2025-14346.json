  "summary": "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued an advisory for a critical vulnerability, CVE-2025-14346, in WHILL electric wheelchairs. The flaw, rated 9.8 on the CVSS scale, stems from a missing authentication mechanism over Bluetooth. It allows an attacker within Bluetooth range (approx. 30 feet) to pair with a device and gain complete control, including issuing movement commands and overriding speed limits. This poses a direct physical safety risk to users. The manufacturer, WHILL Inc., has deployed firmware and application mitigations.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\n\nThe **[U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov)** has issued a medical advisory for a critical vulnerability, **[CVE-2025-14346](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14346)**, affecting electric wheelchairs manufactured by **[WHILL Inc.](https://whill.inc/)**. The flaw, which has a CVSS v3 score of 9.8 (Critical), allows a nearby, unauthenticated attacker to remotely take control of affected wheelchairs via Bluetooth. This could result in unauthorized movement, speed manipulation, and other dangerous actions, posing a direct threat to the physical safety of the user. The vulnerability impacts all versions of the WHILL Model C2 Electric Wheelchair and Model F Power Chair. The manufacturer has released mitigations to address the issue, and there are currently no known public exploits.\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n\nThe root cause of **CVE-2025-14346** is a lack of authentication for critical functions exposed over the device's Bluetooth connection. An attacker within Bluetooth range (approximately 30 feet or 10 meters) can discover and pair with a vulnerable wheelchair without requiring any credentials or user interaction. Once paired, the attacker gains the ability to send commands that are normally restricted to the legitimate user or caregiver. These commands include:\n\n*   Initiating and controlling movement (forward, backward, turning).\n*   Modifying the wheelchair's configuration profiles.\n*   Overriding preset speed limits.\n\nThe vulnerability was discovered and reported by researchers at QED Secure Solutions.\n\n## Affected Systems\n\nThe following products are affected by this vulnerability:\n\n*   **WHILL Model C2 Electric Wheelchair** (all versions)\n*   **WHILL Model F Power Chair** (all versions)\n\nThese devices are used globally within the Healthcare and Public Health sectors.\n\n## Exploitation Status\n\nAs of the CISA advisory, there are no known instances of active exploitation or public proof-of-concept exploits for this vulnerability. However, the low complexity of the attack means that it could be easily weaponized.\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is extremely severe due to the direct risk of physical harm. An attacker could cause a wheelchair to move unexpectedly into traffic, accelerate beyond a safe speed, or become unresponsive to the user's controls. In a hospital or care facility setting, this could be used to cause chaos or target specific individuals. The psychological impact on users, who rely on these devices for mobility and independence, is also significant, as it erodes trust in the safety and security of their assistive technology.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `log_source` | Bluetooth Pairing Logs | On a paired mobile device, look for logs of unexpected or repeated pairing events with the wheelchair. |\n| `other` | Unintended Wheelchair Movement | The most obvious indicator is the wheelchair moving or changing settings without user input. |\n| `certificate_subject` | WHILL Bluetooth Device Name | Attackers may scan for Bluetooth devices with names identifying them as WHILL products. |\n\n## Detection Methods\n\n*   **Bluetooth Scanning**: Security personnel at facilities using these devices could periodically use Bluetooth scanning applications to identify any unauthorized devices attempting to pair with or masquerade as WHILL wheelchairs.\n*   **Behavioral Monitoring**: Caregivers and users should be trained to immediately report any instance of unintended or unresponsive behavior from the wheelchair, which should be treated as a potential security and safety incident.\n\n## Remediation Steps\n\n**[WHILL Inc.](https://whill.inc/)** has deployed several mitigations on December 29, 2025, to address the vulnerability. Users and administrators should ensure these updates are applied:\n\n1.  **Firmware Update**: Apply the updated firmware, which introduces a safeguard to prevent unauthorized modification of speed profiles.\n2.  **Mobile Application Update**: Update the companion mobile application. The new version obfuscates configuration files and includes a feature to block unlock commands while the wheelchair is in motion.\n3.  **User Awareness**: Users should be advised to be cautious of their surroundings and to power off their wheelchair when not in use for extended periods to reduce the window of opportunity for an attacker.\n4.  **Physical Proximity**: As the attack requires close physical proximity, maintaining awareness in public or crowded areas is a practical, though not technical, mitigation.\n\nCISA recommends users follow the guidance provided by WHILL and contact the manufacturer for specific update instructions.",

This is not just a recommendation; it is a critical safety requirement. Users, caregivers, and healthcare facility administrators must ensure that both the wheelchair's firmware and the associated mobile application are updated to the latest versions. The firmware update reportedly adds a safeguard to prevent unauthorized speed changes, while the application update hardens the configuration and blocks certain commands during motion. This multi-layered software fix directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability—the lack of authentication for critical functions. All other measures are merely procedural workarounds; patching is the definitive solution.",

      "recommendation": "The vulnerability in the WHILL wheelchairs is a textbook case where Application Configuration Hardening is required. The flaw exists because the Bluetooth service on the device was configured to accept critical commands without authentication. The remediation provided by WHILL, which includes blocking unlock commands during motion and obfuscating configuration files, is a form of hardening. In general, for IoT and medical devices, all communication channels, especially wireless ones like Bluetooth, must be configured to require authentication and encryption for any function that can affect the device's state or safety. This should be a 'secure-by-default' principle during the design phase, preventing such critical vulnerabilities from ever reaching production.",
