  "summary": "A critical, unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, dubbed 'React2Shell' (CVE-2025-55182), has been disclosed in React Server Components, affecting popular frameworks like Next.js. With a maximum CVSS score of 10.0, the flaw allows attackers to compromise servers with a single crafted HTTP request, requiring no user interaction. The vulnerability stems from an unsafe deserialization process in the 'Flight' protocol. Following the public disclosure on December 3, 2025, multiple weaponized proofs-of-concept became available, and active exploitation attempts by threat actors, including China-nexus groups, were observed. CISA has added CVE-2025-55182 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, mandating immediate patching for federal agencies and urging all organizations to update affected components.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nA **critical unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE)** vulnerability, tracked as **[CVE-2025-55182](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55182)** and nicknamed 'React2Shell', has been discovered in the core implementation of React Server Components (RSC). The flaw, which has a **CVSS score of 10.0 (Critical)**, affects any application using vulnerable versions of `react-server-dom-*` packages, including modern instances of the popular **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** framework. The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by sending a specially crafted HTTP request, with no authentication or user interaction required. Following its public disclosure on December 3, 2025, weaponized exploits were released, and active scanning and exploitation attempts have been detected in the wild. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (**[CISA](https://www.cisa.gov)**) has added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, underscoring the immediate and severe risk to a vast number of web applications. Organizations are urged to apply patches immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\nThe vulnerability resides in the 'Flight' protocol used by React Server Components for server-client communication. Specifically, it is an unsafe deserialization flaw in how React's server-side components decode payloads sent to React Server Function endpoints. An attacker can craft a malicious payload that, when processed by the server, leads to arbitrary code execution. A crucial aspect of this vulnerability is that an application does not need to have explicitly defined any server functions to be exploitable. The mere presence and default configuration of RSC support in frameworks like Next.js is sufficient to expose the server to this attack vector. This makes the attack surface incredibly broad, as many developers may be unaware their applications are vulnerable.\n\nSecurity researchers at **[Wiz](https://www.wiz.io)** demonstrated a reliable proof-of-concept, and multiple PoCs have since been made public, significantly lowering the barrier for malicious actors to launch attacks. The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed by researcher Lachlan Davidson on November 29, 2025, with patches developed by the React team and **[Meta](https://about.meta.com/)** before the public announcement.\n\n## Affected Systems\nThe vulnerability impacts a wide range of tools and frameworks in the React ecosystem. Organizations must check their dependencies for the following packages and versions:\n- **`react-server-dom-webpack`**: Versions 19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, 19.2.0\n- **`react-server-dom-parcel`**: Versions 19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, 19.2.0\n- **`react-server-dom-turbopack`**: Versions 19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, 19.2.0\n- **`Next.js`**: Versions 15.x, 16.x, and Canary builds from 14.3.0\n- Other affected tools include: Vite RSC plugin, Parcel RSC plugin, React Router RSC preview, Redwood SDK, and Waku.\n\n**Patched Versions:**\n- **React Packages**: 19.0.1, 19.1.2, 19.2.1\n- **Next.js**: 16.0.7, 15.5.7, and others. Users should update to the latest available version.\n\n## Exploitation Status\n**Active exploitation of CVE-2025-55182 is confirmed.** Within hours of the public disclosure, multiple threat intelligence firms, including **[Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/)**, reported observing widespread scanning and exploitation attempts. The activity has been linked to known threat actors, including China-nexus groups such as **Earth Lamia** and **Jackpot Panda**. The public availability of weaponized exploits means that attacks are likely to escalate rapidly. On December 5, 2025, CISA added the vulnerability to its KEV catalog, confirming it as a clear and present danger being used in active attacks.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe impact of a successful exploit is severe, granting attackers full control over the compromised server. This can lead to:\n- **Complete System Compromise:** Attackers can install backdoors, ransomware, or cryptominers.\n- **Data Theft:** Sensitive data stored on the server or in connected databases can be exfiltrated.\n- **Pivoting:** The compromised server can be used as a beachhead to launch further attacks into the internal network.\n- **Reputational Damage:** A public breach can erode customer trust and lead to significant financial loss.\n\nGiven that Next.js is one ofthe most popular web development frameworks, the number of vulnerable internet-facing systems is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands, if not millions. The ease of exploitation and the lack of required authentication make this one of the most significant web vulnerabilities of the year.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\nSecurity teams should proactively hunt for signs of compromise. These are not confirmed IOCs but indicators for threat hunting:\n\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `url_pattern` | `/_next/data/` | Monitor for unusual or malformed requests to Next.js data routes. |\n| `http_header` | `RSC` | Analyze `RSC` headers in incoming HTTP requests for anomalous or malicious-looking payloads. |\n| `process_name` | `node` | Monitor `node` processes for unexpected child processes (e.g., `sh`, `bash`, `powershell.exe`), high CPU usage, or outbound network connections to suspicious IPs. |\n| `log_source` | `Web Server Access Logs` | Scrutinize logs for HTTP requests with large or unusually encoded payloads, especially those targeting server function endpoints. Look for 5xx server errors that may indicate failed exploit attempts. |\n| `file_path` | `/tmp/` | Monitor for unexpected files being written or executed from temporary directories by the web server process. |\n\n## Detection & Response\n- **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy WAF rules to inspect and block requests containing known malicious payloads targeting RSC endpoints. Many vendors are releasing emergency rulesets for React2Shell.\n- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Monitor web server processes (e.g., `node`) for anomalous behavior, such as spawning shell processes or making unexpected network connections. This is critical for detecting post-exploitation activity. D3FEND's [`D3-PA: Process Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ProcessAnalysis) can be implemented here.\n- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Monitor for suspicious outbound connections from web servers. Attackers will often establish a C2 channel after a successful exploit. D3FEND's [`D3-NTA: Network Traffic Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkTrafficAnalysis) is a key technique.\n- **Log Analysis:** Correlate web server access logs with EDR process logs to trace suspicious requests through to potential execution on the host. Look for patterns of scanning from single IP addresses across multiple web applications.\n\n## Remediation Steps\n1.  **Immediate Patching:** The highest priority is to update all affected components to their patched versions. Use package managers (`npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`) to update `react-server-dom-*` and `next` packages.\n    ```bash\n    # For Next.js projects using npm\n    npm install next@latest\n    ```\n2.  **Verify Dependencies:** Use tools like `npm ls` or `yarn list` to ensure that no transitive dependencies are pulling in vulnerable versions of the React packages. Snyk and other SCA tools can automate this.\n3.  **Apply WAF Mitigations:** If patching cannot be performed immediately, apply virtual patching rules through a WAF to block known exploit patterns. This should be considered a temporary compensating control, not a substitute for patching.\n4.  **Review Server Configurations:** As a long-term strategy, restrict the attack surface by ensuring that only necessary ports and services are exposed to the internet. D3FEND's [`D3-AH: Application Hardening`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ApplicationHardening) is a relevant countermeasure.",
