  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nThe governments of **Togo** and **Mozambique** have entered into a formal cybersecurity partnership by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). This agreement, finalized during Mozambique's first International Cybersecurity Week, creates a collaborative framework between the two nations' Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs). The core objectives of the pact are to improve collective defense capabilities through the real-time sharing of threat intelligence, joint training and capacity building, and coordinated incident response. This initiative represents a significant step in strengthening the cybersecurity posture of the African continent against a backdrop of increasing digital threats.\n\n---\n\n## Regulatory Details\nThe MoU establishes a formal, non-binding framework for cooperation. While not a legally enforceable treaty, it signifies a strong political commitment from both nations to work together on cybersecurity matters. The agreement outlines the intended areas of collaboration between the national CSIRTs of **[Togo](https://cyberdefense.gouv.tg/)** and **[Mozambique](https://www.infosec.gov.mz/)**.\n\n### Key Pillars of the Agreement:\n1.  **Threat Information Sharing:** A commitment to exchange timely and actionable intelligence on cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and incidents affecting either nation.\n2.  **Capacity Building:** Jointly organized training sessions, workshops, and cybersecurity exercises to enhance the skills and readiness of their respective security teams.\n3.  **Operational Coordination:** Establishing protocols for mutual assistance and coordinated response during major cybersecurity incidents that may span both countries or have regional implications.\n\n## Affected Organizations\n- **Primary:**\n  - **Government of Togo**, specifically its national CSIRT (CERT.tg / ANCy).\n  - **Government of Mozambique**, specifically its National Institute of Information and Communication Technology (INTIC) which oversees the national CSIRT (CERT.mz).\n- **Secondary:**\n  - Government agencies and critical infrastructure operators within both countries.\n  - Regional African bodies focused on cybersecurity, such as the African Union.\n\n## Compliance Requirements\nAs this is a governmental MoU, direct compliance requirements for private sector entities are minimal. However, organizations operating in Togo and Mozambique should be aware of this partnership as it will likely lead to:\n- Increased dissemination of threat intelligence from the national CSIRTs to businesses.\n- Potential for new national cybersecurity regulations or standards aligned with the joint initiatives.\n- Opportunities to participate in public-private partnership events, such as training and information sharing sessions.\n\n## Implementation Timeline\nThe agreement was signed on or around November 19, 2025. The implementation will be phased, with initial efforts likely focused on establishing secure communication channels between the two CSIRTs and planning the first joint capacity-building activities. The timeline for full operational coordination will depend on the successful development of shared protocols and trust between the teams.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThis partnership is a positive development for cybersecurity in Africa. By pooling resources, Togo and Mozambique can achieve more than they could individually:\n- **Improved Threat Visibility:** Sharing intelligence provides a broader view of regional threat campaigns, allowing for more proactive defense.\n- **Enhanced Skills:** Joint training allows for knowledge transfer and the development of specialized cybersecurity skills that may be scarce in the region.\n- **Stronger Incident Response:** Coordinated response efforts can more effectively contain and remediate cross-border cyberattacks.\n- **Regional Leadership:** This bilateral agreement serves as a model for other African nations, potentially encouraging further regional and continent-wide cybersecurity cooperation to address shared threats.\n\n## Compliance Guidance\nFor businesses operating in the region:\n- **Engage with National CSIRTs:** Establish contact with the national CSIRT in your country of operation (CERT.tg in Togo, CERT.mz in Mozambique). Subscribe to their alerts and advisories.\n- **Align with National Strategy:** Stay informed about the national cybersecurity strategies of both countries, as this MoU will influence their direction.\n- **Participate in Information Sharing:** Where possible, participate in local Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) or other public-private forums to contribute to and benefit from the collective intelligence facilitated by this agreement.",
