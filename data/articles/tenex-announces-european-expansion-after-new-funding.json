The expansion, announced on December 2, 2025, is backed by a new strategic investment from **DTCP**, a global investment management firm. This funding is an addition to Tenex's existing $27 million Series A round.

The company has demonstrated remarkable growth, reportedly exceeding $10 million in revenue in its first six months and securing several Fortune 500 clients.\n\nThe initial Series A funding round was led by Crosspoint Capital Partners, with participation from other notable investors like Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).\n\n## Strategic Expansion\nThe new investment from DTCP is specifically aimed at fueling Tenex's expansion into the EMEA region. The company's plans include:\n- Establishing a physical international headquarters in Europe during 2026.\n- Scaling its regional team to provide local sales and support.\n- Tapping into the European AI and cybersecurity talent pool.\n\nTenex CEO Eric Foster stated the expansion is a direct response to the increasing demand for advanced, AI-powered security solutions to combat sophisticated threats against critical infrastructure.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nTenex's rapid growth and expansion highlight several key trends in the cybersecurity industry:\n- **Demand for AI**: There is strong market demand for security solutions that use **[Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)** to automate threat detection and response, reducing reliance on human analysts for routine tasks.\n- **MDR Market Growth**: The Managed Detection and Response market continues to expand as organizations seek to outsource complex security operations.\n- **Investor Confidence**: The continued investment from prominent firms like DTCP, Crosspoint, and a16z signals strong investor confidence in Tenex's technology and business model.\n\nThe company's entry into the EMEA market will increase competition among MDR providers in the region and provides European customers with a new option for AI-native security services.",
