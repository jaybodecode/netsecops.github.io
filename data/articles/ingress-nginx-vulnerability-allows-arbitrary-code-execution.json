  "title": "Ingress-NGINX Vulnerability Allows Attackers to Execute Arbitrary Code",
  "summary": "A critical vulnerability has been discovered in the widely used Ingress-NGINX controller for Kubernetes. The flaw could allow a remote attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the ingress controller. A successful exploit could lead to a full compromise of the ingress, enabling traffic interception, data theft, and providing a powerful foothold for lateral movement into the underlying Kubernetes cluster environment. Users are urged to patch immediately.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\n\nA critical vulnerability has been disclosed in the **[Ingress-NGINX](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/)** controller, one of the most popular solutions for managing external access to services in a **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)** cluster. The flaw can be exploited by an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution (RCE) on the ingress controller pod itself. Because the ingress controller is a privileged component that handles and routes all incoming traffic, its compromise has severe security implications. An attacker could intercept sensitive data, manipulate traffic, and, most dangerously, use the compromised ingress pod as a staging point to attack other services within the cluster. Administrators of **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)** clusters using **[Ingress-NGINX](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/)** must treat this as a high-priority threat and apply available patches or mitigations immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n\nThe source article does not provide a CVE ID or specific technical details of the vulnerability. However, based on the description, the flaw likely resides in how the ingress controller parses configuration snippets or annotations within an Ingress object. A malicious user with permissions to create or modify Ingress objects could potentially craft a payload that, when processed by the controller, leads to command injection or another form of code execution within the NGINX pod.\n\nThis is a form of [`T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/), but with the added context of a cloud-native environment, where it can also lead to [`T1610 - Deploy Container`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1610/) or other container escape techniques.\n\n## Affected Systems\n\nAll **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)** clusters that use a vulnerable version of the community-supported **[Ingress-NGINX](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/)** controller are affected. It is crucial to distinguish this from the F5-supported NGINX Ingress Controller, which is a different product.\n\n## Exploitation Status\n\nThe articles do not specify if the vulnerability is being actively exploited. However, given its criticality and the widespread use of **[Ingress-NGINX](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/)**, it is highly likely that proof-of-concept exploits will be developed quickly.\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\nThe impact of a successful exploit is critical. An attacker with code execution on the ingress controller pod can:\n-   **Intercept Traffic:** Read, modify, or redirect any and all traffic passing through the ingress, including traffic containing sensitive data like credentials, PII, and API keys.\n-   **Access Cluster Secrets:** The ingress controller pod often has access to TLS certificates and other secrets stored within the **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)** cluster.\n-   **Lateral Movement:** The compromised pod can be used as a beachhead to attack other services within the cluster network. If the pod is running with a privileged service account, the attacker may be able to query the **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)** API server, create new pods, and potentially achieve a full cluster takeover.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n\n| Type | Value | Description | Context | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| log_source | `ingress-nginx-controller logs` | Monitor the logs of the ingress controller pods for anomalous error messages, unexpected reloads, or evidence of command execution. | Kubernetes logging stack (e.g., Fluentd, Logstash) | high |\n| process_name | `nginx` | Monitor for the `nginx` process inside the ingress pod spawning unexpected child processes like `sh`, `bash`, or `curl`. | Container runtime security tools, EDR for nodes | high |\n| api_endpoint | `Kubernetes API Server` | Monitor for unusual API calls originating from the IP address of the ingress controller pods, such as attempts to list secrets or create pods in other namespaces. | Kubernetes audit logs | high |\n\n## Detection Methods\n\n1.  **Kubernetes Audit Logging:** Enable and analyze **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)** audit logs. Look for suspicious activity originating from the ingress controller's service account, such as creating, updating, or deleting resources outside of its normal behavior.\n2.  **Container Runtime Security:** Use a container runtime security tool (e.g., Falco, Trivy) to monitor for anomalous behavior within the ingress controller pods, such as unexpected process execution, file modifications, or outbound network connections.\n3.  **Review Ingress Objects:** Regularly audit Ingress objects for suspicious annotations or configurations, especially in multi-tenant clusters where non-admin users can create them.\n\n## Remediation Steps\n\n1.  **Patch Immediately:** The primary remediation is to upgrade the **[Ingress-NGINX](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/)** controller to a patched version as soon as it is released. Follow the official project's guidance for upgrading.\n2.  **Restrict Permissions:** As a general best practice, limit the permissions of users who can create and modify Ingress objects. Use RBAC policies to ensure that only trusted administrators can manage ingress configuration.\n3.  **Network Policies:** Implement **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)** Network Policies to restrict traffic from the ingress controller pods. They should only be allowed to communicate with the specific backend services they are configured to route to, not the entire cluster network.",

Establish a process to subscribe to security announcements from the Ingress-NGINX project to ensure you are notified of future vulnerabilities.

      "recommendation": "As a critical defense-in-depth measure, implement strict Kubernetes Network Policies to isolate the Ingress-NGINX pods. By default, pods in a Kubernetes cluster can communicate with all other pods. A Network Policy should be created that defines a default-deny posture for the ingress pods. Then, add explicit egress rules that only allow the ingress pods to communicate with the specific backend services and ports they are supposed to route traffic to. This will prevent a compromised ingress pod from being used for lateral movement to scan the internal cluster network or attack other applications, significantly containing the impact of a potential RCE.",
