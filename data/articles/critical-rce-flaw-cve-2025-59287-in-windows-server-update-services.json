  "title": "Critical Unauthenticated RCE Vulnerability (CVE-2025-59287, CVSS 9.8) Disclosed in Microsoft WSUS",
  "summary": "A critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, CVE-2025-59287, with a CVSS score of 9.8, has been discovered in Microsoft's Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). The flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker on the same network to gain SYSTEM-level privileges on a vulnerable server by sending a maliciously crafted cookie. The vulnerability stems from an unsafe deserialization process. While not yet exploited in the wild, Microsoft rates exploitation as \"more likely.\" Given that compromising WSUS could enable an attacker to distribute malicious updates across an entire enterprise, immediate patching is strongly advised.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nA **critical vulnerability**, **CVE-2025-59287**, has been disclosed in **[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/security)** **[Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-server-update-services/get-started/windows-server-update-services-wsus)**. This flaw carries a CVSS base score of 9.8 (Critical) and allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to achieve remote code execution (RCE) with `SYSTEM` privileges on the WSUS server. The attack can be initiated by sending a specially crafted encrypted cookie to a specific web service endpoint. A successful exploit would grant an attacker complete control over the update server, potentially enabling a catastrophic internal supply chain attack. **Microsoft** released a patch as part of the October 2025 Patch Tuesday, and administrators are urged to apply it immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n- **CVE ID:** **CVE-2025-59287**\n- **CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical)\n- **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n- **Description:** The vulnerability lies within the `GetCookie()` endpoint of the WSUS web service. It is caused by the unsafe deserialization of an `AuthorizationCookie` object. The server's `EncryptionHelper.DecryptData()` method uses a hardcoded AES-128-CBC key to decrypt cookie data provided by an attacker. The decrypted data is then passed to `BinaryFormatter` for deserialization without any type validation.\n\nThis lack of validation is the crux of the issue. An attacker can craft a malicious object, serialize it, encrypt it using the known AES key and initialization vector, and send it within the `AuthorizationCookie`. The server will blindly decrypt and deserialize this object, leading directly to arbitrary code execution in the context of the WSUS application pool, which runs with `SYSTEM` privileges.\n\n> This type of vulnerability is particularly dangerous because it is unauthenticated, requires no user interaction, and results in the highest level of privilege on a highly sensitive server.\n\n---\n\n## Affected Systems\n- All versions of **[Windows Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Server)** running the Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) role are affected.\n- This includes but is not limited to Windows Server 2016, 2019, and 2022.\n\n---\n\n## Exploitation Status\nAs of the disclosure, **Microsoft** is not aware of any active exploitation of **CVE-2025-59287** in the wild. However, the company has assessed that exploitation is \"more likely.\" Given the public availability of technical details and the critical nature of the flaw, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits are expected to be developed quickly by security researchers and threat actors.\n\n---\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe impact of exploiting this vulnerability is catastrophic. A WSUS server is a central point of trust within an enterprise network, responsible for approving and distributing software updates to all Windows clients and servers. An attacker with `SYSTEM` access to a WSUS server could:\n- **Deploy Malware Enterprise-Wide:** Approve and push malicious updates disguised as legitimate patches from Microsoft, leading to a widespread compromise of the entire organization.\n- **Denial of Service:** Prevent legitimate security patches from being deployed, leaving the organization vulnerable to other attacks.\n- **Espionage and Data Exfiltration:** Use the WSUS server as a powerful, trusted pivot point to move laterally across the network and exfiltrate sensitive data.\n\nCompromising WSUS is a classic supply chain attack, but one that occurs inside the victim's own network perimeter.\n\n---\n\n## Detection Methods\n- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use authenticated vulnerability scans to identify WSUS servers that are missing the October 2025 security update.\n- **Web Log Analysis:** Monitor IIS logs on WSUS servers for requests to the `GetCookie()` endpoint in `/ClientWebService/client.asmx`. While some legitimate traffic may exist, a spike in requests or requests from unusual internal IP addresses should be investigated.\n- **Endpoint Monitoring:** An EDR solution on the WSUS server may detect suspicious post-exploitation activity, such as the spawning of `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe` by the `w3wp.exe` process associated with the WSUS application pool.\n\n**D3FEND Techniques for Detection:**\n- [`D3-NTA - Network Traffic Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkTrafficAnalysis): Can be used to monitor for and alert on suspicious connections to the WSUS web service endpoints from unexpected sources.\n\n---\n\n## Remediation Steps\n1.  **Apply Security Update Immediately:** The only effective remediation is to install the security updates for **CVE-2025-59287** released in the October 2025 Patch Tuesday. This should be treated as an emergency change.\n2.  **Network Segmentation (Compensating Control):** If patching is not immediately possible, restrict network access to the WSUS server. Only client endpoints that need to receive updates and a small number of administrative workstations should be able to communicate with it on the required ports (typically 8530/8531).\n3.  **Verify Patching:** After deployment, confirm that the patch has been successfully installed on all WSUS servers in the environment.\n\n**D3FEND Countermeasures:**\n- **Harden:** The primary countermeasure is [`D3-SU - Software Update`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SoftwareUpdate). Applying the patch from Microsoft directly fixes the unsafe deserialization flaw.\n- **Isolate:** As a compensating control, use [`D3-NI - Network Isolation`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkIsolation) to limit network access to the WSUS server, reducing its attack surface.",

This vulnerability allows an attacker with *any* network access to the server to exploit it. Therefore, it is vital to reduce that access to the absolute minimum. Configure firewall rules to ensure that only client subnets can communicate with the WSUS server on its required ports (e.g., 8530/8531), and only a small, dedicated set of administrative jump boxes can access it for management purposes. All other inbound traffic should be explicitly denied. This network isolation drastically reduces the attack surface, ensuring that only a limited number of systems could even attempt to exploit CVE-2025-59287, even before it is patched.",
