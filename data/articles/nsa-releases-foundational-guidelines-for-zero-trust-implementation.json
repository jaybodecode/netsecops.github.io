  "summary": "The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has released the first two documents in its new Zero Trust Implementation Guidelines (ZIGs) series. The 'Primer' and 'Discovery Phase' guides are designed to provide federal agencies and other organizations with a foundational roadmap for adopting a Zero Trust security architecture. This initiative aligns with the Department of War's mandate for agencies to achieve specific Zero Trust targets and emphasizes the critical first step of gaining comprehensive visibility across all data, applications, assets, and services (DAAS).",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nThe U.S. **[National Security Agency (NSA)](https://www.nsa.gov)** has published the first two installments of its Zero Trust Implementation Guidelines (ZIGs), aiming to provide a clear and actionable path for organizations, particularly within the federal government, to transition to a **[Zero Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model)** architecture. The new documents, a \"Primer\" and a guide for the \"Discovery Phase,\" establish the strategic foundation for the series. They are aligned with the Department of War (DoW) CIO's Zero Trust Framework, which mandates that defense agencies implement 91 specific activities. The NSA's guidance focuses on helping organizations build essential visibility into their environments as the critical first step before deploying advanced Zero Trust controls.\n\n## Regulatory Details\nThe ZIG series represents a strategic effort by the NSA to operationalize high-level Zero Trust concepts into practical, modular guidance. \n\n### The Primer\nThe \"Primer\" serves as an introduction to the entire ZIG series. It outlines the core principles and the overall modular approach. This design acknowledges that organizations are at different levels of maturity and allows them to adopt capabilities that fit their specific needs and priorities, rather than enforcing a rigid, linear implementation plan. The NSA intends for this new series to eventually supersede and update its previous Cybersecurity Information Sheet (CSI) publications on Zero Trust.\n\n### The Discovery Phase\nThis document details the critical first phase of any Zero Trust journey: discovery. It emphasizes that before any controls can be implemented, an organization must achieve comprehensive visibility. The key activities outlined include:\n1.  **Identify and Catalog DAAS:** Create a complete inventory of all Data, Applications, Assets, and Services.\n2.  **Identify and Catalog Users and Entities:** Document all human users (Personal Entities or PEs) and non-human entities (Non-Person Entities or NPEs), such as service accounts and APIs.\n3.  **Map Access and Authorization:** Analyze and map all existing access patterns, data flows, and authorization activities to understand who and what is accessing resources, and why.\n\nThis foundational baseline is essential for informed strategic planning, prioritizing implementation efforts, and measuring progress against Zero Trust goals.\n\n## Affected Organizations\nWhile the guidance is primarily aimed at U.S. federal agencies and organizations within the Department of War ecosystem, its principles and recommendations are broadly applicable to any public or private sector entity seeking to implement a Zero Trust architecture. The documents are intended for a wide audience, including:\n-   System Owners and Administrators\n-   Cybersecurity Professionals\n-   IT Architects and Planners\n-   Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs)\n\n## Compliance Requirements\nFor DoW agencies, this guidance directly supports the mandate to achieve \"target level\" Zero Trust maturity by implementing 91 specific activities. The \"Discovery Phase\" provides the necessary steps to build the foundation required for subsequent phases, which will cover more advanced capabilities. Adherence to this guidance will be crucial for demonstrating compliance with federal cybersecurity directives and maturing an organization's security posture.\n\n## Implementation Timeline\nThe release of the \"Primer\" and \"Discovery Phase\" marks the beginning of the NSA's ZIG series. The agency has announced that subsequent documents detailing Phase One and Phase Two implementation steps will be released in the near future. Organizations are advised to begin their discovery phase now to prepare for the more technical guidance to come. The process of discovery is not a one-time project but an ongoing activity that must be maintained as the IT environment evolves.\n\n## Compliance Guidance\nOrganizations should take the following steps to align with the new NSA guidance:\n1.  **Review the Guidance:** Key stakeholders should thoroughly read both the \"Primer\" and \"Discovery Phase\" documents to understand the NSA's strategic approach.\n2.  **Assemble a Cross-Functional Team:** The discovery process requires input from IT, security, application owners, and business units. Form a dedicated team to lead this effort.\n3.  **Leverage Existing Tools:** Utilize existing asset management, identity and access management (IAM), and network monitoring tools to begin cataloging DAAS and user entities. This can be supported by D3FEND techniques like **[Domain Account Monitoring (D3-DAM)](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:DomainAccountMonitoring)** and **[System File Analysis (D3-SFA)](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SystemFileAnalysis)**.\n4.  **Prioritize Critical Systems:** Begin the discovery process by focusing on the most critical and sensitive systems and data stores. This will provide the most immediate risk reduction insights.\n5.  **Establish a Continuous Monitoring Baseline:** Use the initial discovery data to establish a baseline of normal activity. This baseline is fundamental for future anomaly detection and policy enforcement, aligning with MITRE ATT&CK Mitigation **[M1047 - Audit](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1047/)**.",

This involves configuring detailed audit policies on domain controllers to log all account creation, modification, deletion, and usage events (e.g., Windows Event IDs 4720, 4722, 4738, 4624). These logs should be forwarded to a central SIEM for analysis. By monitoring these events, security teams can create an accurate, up-to-date inventory of all human and non-person entities, identify stale or unauthorized accounts, and establish a baseline of normal authentication patterns. This is the foundational data source for building Zero Trust policies.",

Deploy NetFlow, sFlow, or IPFIX collectors on all major network segments, routers, and switches. Ingest this flow data into a network detection and response (NDR) tool or SIEM. This will provide comprehensive visibility into which assets are communicating with each other, over which ports and protocols, and the volume of data being transferred. This map of 'who is talking to whom' is essential for identifying implicit trust zones and designing future microsegmentation policies, a key outcome of the Zero Trust journey.",

      "recommendation": "To fully identify and catalog all 'Assets' and 'Applications' as required by the NSA guidance, organizations should leverage System File Analysis. This can be achieved through a combination of tools. A Configuration Management Database (CMDB) provides a starting point, but it must be validated and enriched with data from endpoint agents (EDR, asset inventory tools) that can scan file systems to identify installed software, versions, and configurations. This process helps discover unmanaged or 'shadow IT' applications. Correlating this application data with the network flows from D3-NTA allows an organization to build a complete picture of its 'DAAS' (Data, Applications, Assets, and Services) landscape.",
