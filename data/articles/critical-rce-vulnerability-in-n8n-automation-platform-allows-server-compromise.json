  "summary": "A critical sandbox escape vulnerability, CVE-2026-25049, has been discovered in the popular n8n workflow automation platform. The flaw, rated 9.4 on the CVSS scale, allows an authenticated user with permission to edit workflows to bypass security controls and execute arbitrary system commands on the host server. This could lead to a full server compromise, exposing sensitive credentials, API keys, and OAuth tokens stored in the environment. The vulnerability is a bypass for a previously patched RCE flaw, and administrators are urged to update to n8n versions 1.123.17 or 2.5.2 immediately to prevent potential hijacking of connected cloud services and AI pipelines.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nA critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, **[CVE-2026-25049](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/critical-n8n-flaw-cve-2026-25049.html)**, has been disclosed in the **[n8n](https://n8n.io/)** open-source workflow automation platform. The vulnerability, which carries a **CVSS score of 9.4**, is a sandbox escape that allows an authenticated attacker with workflow editing permissions to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying server. Successful exploitation can lead to a complete server compromise, granting the attacker access to all environment variables, which often contain highly sensitive credentials, API keys, and OAuth tokens for connected services. This could allow an attacker to pivot and take control of integrated cloud accounts and AI pipelines. The flaw is a bypass for a previous RCE vulnerability (CVE-2025-68613), emphasizing the severity of the issue. The n8n team has released patches, and all users are strongly advised to upgrade to versions `1.123.17` or `2.5.2` immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n**CVE-2026-25049** is a sandbox escape vulnerability within n8n's JavaScript expression evaluation engine. The platform uses a sandbox to safely execute user-provided code within workflows, but researchers at security firm **Pillar** discovered a method to bypass this protection.\n\nThe flaw can be triggered by an authenticated user who has permissions to create or edit a workflow. By crafting a malicious JavaScript expression using specific properties with a template literal or certain arrow functions, an attacker can break out of the sandboxed environment. Once the sandbox is escaped, the attacker can execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the n8n service account.\n\nThis is particularly dangerous because n8n is designed to connect to and automate a wide range of other services. A compromise of the n8n server itself effectively hands the keys to all connected applications to the attacker.\n\n---\n\n## Affected Systems\n- **Product:** n8n Workflow Automation Platform\n- **Affected Versions:** All versions prior to `1.123.17` and `2.5.2`.\n- **Patched Versions:** `1.123.17` and `2.5.2`.\n\n---\n\n## Exploitation Status\nThere is no evidence of active exploitation in the wild at the time of disclosure. However, given the criticality of the vulnerability and the public availability of the details, organizations should assume that exploitation attempts are imminent. The low complexity of the attack (once a valid account is obtained) makes it an attractive target for threat actors.\n\n---\n\n## Impact Assessment\nA successful exploit of **CVE-2026-25049** can have a catastrophic impact, representing a significant supply chain risk.\n\n- **Full Server Compromise:** Attackers gain RCE on the host server, allowing them to install backdoors, exfiltrate data, or use the server as a pivot point.\n- **Credential and API Key Theft:** The primary impact is the theft of all credentials stored as environment variables or within the n8n instance. This includes API keys, database credentials, and OAuth tokens for countless third-party services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Slack, CRMs).\n- **Hijacking of Connected Services:** With the stolen credentials, attackers can take over connected cloud accounts, access or manipulate data in integrated applications, and disrupt business-critical automated workflows.\n- **Lateral Movement:** The compromised n8n server can be used to attack other systems within the internal network.\n\n---\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\nDetecting exploitation requires monitoring the n8n server and its logs.\n\n| Type | Value | Description | Context | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| command_line_pattern | n8n process spawning unexpected child processes like `sh`, `bash`, `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`. | A strong indicator of successful sandbox escape and command execution. | EDR, Sysmon Event ID 1 | high |\n| network_traffic_pattern | Outbound connections from the n8n server to suspicious IP addresses (e.g., reverse shells). | Attacker establishing a C2 channel after successful exploitation. | Firewall logs, NetFlow | high |\n| log_source | n8n application logs | Look for logs containing suspicious JavaScript code snippets with template literals or arrow functions being saved in workflows. | Application log monitoring | medium |\n\n---\n\n## Detection Methods\n1.  **Version Checking:** The most straightforward detection method is to inventory all n8n instances and check if they are running a vulnerable version (prior to `1.123.17` or `2.5.2`).\n2.  **Endpoint Monitoring:** Deploy an EDR agent on the n8n host server. Create detection rules to alert on the n8n process spawning shell processes or network utilities like `curl` and `wget`.\n3.  **Audit User Permissions:** Regularly audit which users have permission to create and edit workflows in n8n. Any user with these permissions can exploit this vulnerability, so access should be tightly controlled.\n\n---\n\n## Remediation Steps\nImmediate action is required to mitigate this critical risk.\n\n1.  **Patch Immediately:** The primary and most effective remediation is to upgrade all n8n instances to a patched version (`1.123.17` or `2.5.2`). This is a direct application of [`M1051 - Update Software`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1051/).\n2.  **Restrict Permissions (Temporary Mitigation):** If patching is not immediately possible, as a temporary measure, revoke workflow creation and editing permissions from all non-essential and untrusted users. This limits the number of accounts that could be used to exploit the flaw. This aligns with the principle of least privilege ([`M1026 - Privileged Account Management`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1026/)).\n3.  **Rotate Credentials:** After patching, it is highly recommended to rotate all credentials, API keys, and secrets stored in the n8n environment as a precaution against prior, undetected compromise.",

An EDR solution should be configured to monitor the n8n process and its children. A high-fidelity detection rule should be created to alert any time the n8n parent process spawns a shell (`sh`, `bash`, `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`) or a network utility (`curl`, `wget`, `nc`). Under normal operation, the n8n application should never create such child processes. This behavior is a strong indicator of a successful sandbox escape and subsequent command execution. Correlating this alert with network logs showing new, unexpected outbound connections from the server can further confirm a compromise and help identify a C2 channel.",
