  "summary": "A high-severity command injection vulnerability, CVE-2025-53967, has been discovered and patched in the 'figma-developer-mcp' Model Context Protocol server, a tool used with the Figma design platform. The flaw, rated with a CVSS score of 7.5, could allow an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on a server running the tool. The vulnerability, discovered by Imperva, stemmed from the unsanitized use of user input in command-line strings. Users are urged to update to the patched version to mitigate the risk of server compromise.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nOn October 8, 2025, security researchers disclosed a high-severity command injection vulnerability, **[CVE-2025-53967](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-53967)**, affecting the `figma-developer-mcp` Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. This open-source tool is used to connect AI coding agents with the **[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)** design platform. The vulnerability, which has a CVSS score of 7.5 (High), could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server where the tool is running. The flaw was discovered by researchers at **[Imperva](https://www.imperva.com/)** in July 2025 and has since been patched. Developers and organizations using this tool are strongly advised to update to the latest version to prevent potential server compromise and data theft.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n*   **CVE ID:** `CVE-2025-53967`\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.5 (High)\n*   **Description:** The vulnerability is a classic command injection flaw. The MCP server improperly sanitized user-supplied input before incorporating it into a command-line string that is executed on the server. An attacker could inject shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `&&`) into the input to append and execute arbitrary commands.\n*   **Attack Vector:** The attack can be performed remotely and without authentication. Imperva researchers noted that an attacker could potentially use indirect prompt injection to trick an AI coding agent (the MCP client) into sending a malicious payload to the vulnerable server, leading to RCE.\n\n---\n\n## Affected Systems\n*   **Product:** `figma-developer-mcp` Model Context Protocol (MCP) server\n*   **Versions:** All versions prior to the patched release are considered vulnerable. Users should consult the project's repository for the specific patched version number.\n\n---\n\n## Exploitation Status\nThere is currently no evidence of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild. It was responsibly disclosed to the project maintainers by Imperva, and a patch was made available before the public announcement.\n\n---\n\n## Impact Assessment\nSuccessful exploitation of `CVE-2025-53967` could lead to:\n\n*   **Server Compromise:** An attacker could gain full control over the server running the `figma-developer-mcp` tool, with the privileges of the server process.\n*   **Data Theft:** The attacker could access and exfiltrate any sensitive data stored on the server, including source code, API keys, and other developer credentials.\n*   **Lateral Movement:** The compromised server could be used as a pivot point to launch further attacks against the internal developer network.\n*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker could disrupt the server or delete critical files, impacting development workflows that rely on the tool.\n\n---\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| Log Source | MCP Server Application Logs | Review application logs for input strings containing shell metacharacters like `;`, `|`, `&&`, `$(...)`, or `` `...` ``. |\n| Process Name | Anomalous child processes of the MCP server | Monitor for the MCP server process spawning unexpected child processes like `sh`, `bash`, `nc`, `curl`, or `wget`. |\n| Command Line Pattern | Command-line strings with injected commands | If command-line logging is enabled (e.g., Windows Event ID 4688), look for executed commands that show evidence of injection. |\n\n---\n\n## Detection Methods\n*   **Dependency Scanning:** Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to scan developer environments and CI/CD pipelines to identify any projects using the vulnerable `figma-developer-mcp` package. This is an application of D3FEND's **[Software Update (D3-SU)](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SoftwareUpdate)** process.\n*   **Static/Dynamic Analysis (SAST/DAST):** Employ application security testing tools to scan internally developed code for similar command injection flaws where user input is passed to a system shell. This aligns with **[Dynamic Analysis (D3-DA)](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:DynamicAnalysis)**.\n*   **Endpoint Monitoring:** Use an EDR solution on developer servers to monitor for suspicious process creation events originating from the MCP server process.\n\n---\n\n## Remediation Steps\n1.  **Update Immediately (M1051):** The primary remediation is to update the `figma-developer-mcp` package to the latest patched version. Developers should check their project dependencies and ensure they are no longer using a vulnerable version.\n2.  **Input Sanitization:** As a general best practice, developers should always treat user input as untrusted. Avoid passing user-controlled data directly to system shells. Instead, use parameterized queries or functions that do not interpret shell metacharacters.\n3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run server processes like the MCP server with the minimum privileges necessary for them to function. This can limit the impact of a successful RCE exploit.",

Development teams using this tool must immediately check their project's dependencies (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, etc.) and run the appropriate package manager command (e.g., `npm update figma-developer-mcp`) to install the secure version. To prevent future issues, organizations should use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools integrated into their CI/CD pipelines. These tools automatically scan for vulnerable dependencies in every build, providing an early warning and allowing developers to patch flaws before they reach production environments. This proactive approach to dependency management is essential for mitigating risks from open-source software.",

      "recommendation": "Beyond patching this specific flaw, developers should adopt secure coding practices related to application hardening to prevent command injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, never construct command-line strings by concatenating user-supplied input. Instead, use safe, parameterized APIs provided by the programming language (e.g., Node.js's `execFile` or `spawn` functions instead of `exec`) that handle arguments securely and do not interpret shell metacharacters. All user input must be treated as untrusted and should be strictly validated against an allow-list of expected characters and formats. Implementing static application security testing (SAST) tools in the development lifecycle can automatically scan code for these dangerous patterns and flag them for remediation before the code is ever deployed.",

      "recommendation": "For runtime protection, the server process for `figma-developer-mcp` can be hardened using system call filtering. Technologies like seccomp-bpf on Linux can be used to define a strict profile of allowed system calls for the application. Since the application's legitimate function is unlikely to require spawning arbitrary shell processes, the `execve` system call (and its variants) can be blocked entirely or restricted to only allow execution of specific, known binaries. This creates a strong security boundary. If an attacker successfully exploits the command injection flaw and attempts to execute a malicious command (e.g., `/bin/sh -c '...malicious payload...'`), the operating system kernel will block the forbidden system call and terminate the process, preventing the RCE and alerting security teams to the attempt. This is an effective way to contain the impact of an unknown or unpatched vulnerability.",
