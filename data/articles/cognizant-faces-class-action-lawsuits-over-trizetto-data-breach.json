  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nGlobal IT services provider **[Cognizant](https://www.cognizant.com)** is facing significant legal challenges following a data breach at its healthcare subsidiary, TriZetto Provider Solutions (TPS). Multiple class-action lawsuits have been filed, accusing the company of negligence in protecting vast amounts of sensitive patient data, including Protected Health Information (PHI). The suits allege not only a failure to implement adequate security controls but also a significant delay in notifying victims, exacerbating the potential harm. This incident highlights the immense responsibility and legal liability carried by third-party service providers in the healthcare sector and underscores the severe consequences of failing to meet data protection obligations under regulations like **[HIPAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act)**.\n\n## Incident Overview\nTriZetto Provider Solutions (TPS) acts as a technology and services provider for healthcare organizations, processing claims and managing patient data. This central role makes it a high-value target for threat actors. While the exact technical details and timeline of the breach have not been fully disclosed by Cognizant, the lawsuits contend that hackers successfully accessed and potentially exfiltrated sensitive data. A key point in the legal filings is the allegation of a prolonged notification delay. Under many data breach notification laws, including HIPAA's Breach Notification Rule, companies are required to notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay. The lawsuits argue that Cognizant's failure to do so left millions of patients unaware that their data was compromised, preventing them from taking protective actions like freezing their credit or monitoring their accounts.\n\n## Impact Assessment\n-   **For Affected Individuals:** The breach exposes patients to a high risk of medical identity theft, financial fraud, and highly targeted phishing attacks. The exposure of PHI is particularly damaging, as it can be used to fraudulently obtain medical services or prescriptions, which can have life-threatening consequences.\n-   **For Cognizant/TriZetto:** The company faces severe financial and reputational damage. This includes the cost of litigation, potential multi-million dollar settlements or judgments, and regulatory fines from agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The breach erodes trust with their healthcare clients and could lead to a loss of business.\n-   **For the Healthcare Sector:** This incident serves as another stark reminder of the systemic risk posed by third-party vendors (Business Associates under HIPAA). A single breach at a major processor like TriZetto can have a cascading effect, impacting dozens or hundreds of healthcare providers and millions of patients.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Context\nThe lawsuits likely claim violations of various state and federal laws, including:\n-   **Negligence:** Failure to exercise reasonable care in securing sensitive data.\n-   **Breach of Contract:** Failure to meet the data security obligations outlined in contracts with their healthcare clients.\n-   **State Consumer Protection Laws:** Many states have laws that allow consumers to sue for damages resulting from a data breach.\n-   **HIPAA:** While individuals cannot directly sue for HIPAA violations, the findings of a HIPAA investigation by HHS can be used as evidence of negligence in a class-action suit. The alleged notification delay could be a direct violation of the Breach Notification Rule.\n\n## Lessons Learned & Recommendations\nThis incident provides critical lessons for organizations, especially those acting as third-party data processors.\n\n1.  **Proactive Security is Non-Negotiable:** Companies handling sensitive data must move beyond compliance-driven security and adopt a proactive, defense-in-depth strategy. This includes robust access controls, network segmentation, continuous monitoring, and regular penetration testing.\n2.  **Incident Response and Communication Plan:** Have a well-documented and practiced incident response plan. A critical component of this plan must be a clear communication strategy that adheres to all legal and regulatory notification deadlines. Delays in notification not only harm victims but also significantly increase legal liability.\n3.  **Supply Chain Risk Management:** Healthcare providers (Covered Entities) must conduct thorough due diligence on their vendors (Business Associates). This includes reviewing their security audits, certifications, and incident response capabilities before entrusting them with PHI.\n4.  **Assume a Breach Mentality:** Operate under the assumption that a breach will occur. Focus on detection and response capabilities to quickly identify, contain, and eradicate threats, minimizing the dwell time and overall impact.",
