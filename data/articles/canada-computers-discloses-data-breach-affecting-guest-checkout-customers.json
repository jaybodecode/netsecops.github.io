  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\n**[Canada Computers Inc.](https://www.canadacomputers.com/)**, a prominent Canadian technology retailer, has publicly disclosed a data breach that occurred on its e-commerce platform. The breach, discovered on January 22, 2026, affected customers who made purchases using the 'guest' checkout option over a nearly four-week period from December 29, 2025, to January 22, 2026. An unauthorized third party gained access to a system supporting the retail website, potentially compromising customers' personal details and credit card information. The company, which operates 39 retail locations, has notified law enforcement and is investigating the incident. Customers with registered member accounts are reportedly not impacted.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\n- **Victim:** Canada Computers Inc.\n- **Affected Parties:** Customers using the 'guest' checkout feature.\n- **Data Exposed:** Personal information and credit card details.\n- **Exposure Window:** December 29, 2025 – January 22, 2026.\n\nWhile the company has not specified the technical cause of the breach, this type of incident often points to a compromise of the web server or e-commerce application. This could be due to a vulnerability in the platform (e.g., Magento, Shopify), a compromised plugin, or a web-skimming attack (Magecart-style) where malicious code is injected into the checkout page to steal payment information in real-time.\n\n## Technical Analysis (Hypothetical)\nBased on the description of credit card information being compromised on a website, a **web-skimming** attack is a highly probable scenario.\n\n**Web Skimming (Magecart) Attack Chain:**\n1.  **Initial Compromise:** An attacker gains access to the website's server or a third-party script integrated into the site. This could be through an unpatched vulnerability, stolen admin credentials, or a supply chain attack on a JavaScript library.\n2.  **Code Injection:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the website's checkout page.\n3.  **Data Skimming:** When a customer enters their personal and payment details into the checkout form, the malicious script captures this information from the form fields as it is typed or submitted.\n4.  **Exfiltration:** The captured data is sent to an attacker-controlled server, often disguised as a request to a legitimate-looking domain.\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK Techniques (Probable)\n- **[`T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/):** A likely initial access vector if a vulnerability was exploited.\n- **[`T1506 - Web-based Data Manipulation`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1506/):** The core of a web-skimming attack, where the content of the checkout page is modified to include the malicious script.\n- **[`T1040 - Network Sniffing`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040/):** In this context, the malicious script 'sniffs' data from the browser's DOM before it's encrypted for submission.\n- **[`T1048 - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048/):** The skimmed data is exfiltrated to the attacker's server.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nAffected customers are now at risk of credit card fraud and identity theft. They must monitor their financial statements for unauthorized charges and consider placing fraud alerts on their credit files. For Canada Computers, the impact includes significant costs for forensic investigation, customer notification, credit monitoring services, and potential regulatory fines under Canadian privacy laws like **[PIPEDA](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/)**. The breach also causes substantial reputational damage, which could lead to a loss of customer trust and sales.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| Network Traffic Pattern | Outbound POST requests from checkout page to unknown domains. | A key indicator of a web-skimming script exfiltrating data. |\n| File Path | (Modified JS files) | Monitor for unexpected changes to JavaScript files loaded on the checkout page. |\n| Log Source | `Content Security Policy (CSP) violation reports` | A well-configured CSP can block and report attempts by malicious scripts to exfiltrate data. |\n\n## Detection & Response\n1.  **Code Integrity Monitoring:** E-commerce operators should regularly scan their website's source code, particularly JavaScript files, for any unauthorized modifications. This can be automated with file integrity monitoring (FIM) tools.\n2.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control which domains the website can load scripts from and send data to. This can prevent the skimmer from executing or exfiltrating data. This is a form of **[`D3-ACH - Application Configuration Hardening`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ApplicationConfigurationHardening)**.\n3.  **Third-Party Script Auditing:** Regularly audit all third-party scripts and services integrated into the website. A compromise in any one of these can lead to a breach.\n\n## Mitigation\n1.  **PCI DSS Compliance:** Adhere strictly to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). This includes regular vulnerability scanning, secure coding practices, and network segmentation.\n2.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to protect against common web application attacks that could lead to an initial compromise.\n3.  **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use SRI for all third-party scripts. This ensures that the script loaded by the browser has not been tampered with.\n4.  **Prompt Patching:** Ensure the e-commerce platform, all plugins, and the underlying server software are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.",

      "recommendation": "To prevent web-skimming attacks like the one that likely affected Canada Computers, implementing a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) is a critical hardening measure. A CSP is an HTTP header that tells the browser which domains are trusted sources of content. For the checkout page, the CSP should be configured to only allow scripts to be loaded from the company's own domain and the domains of its trusted payment processor. Furthermore, the `connect-src` directive should be used to restrict where data can be sent, preventing the malicious script from exfiltrating skimmed credit card data to an attacker's server. By setting up a CSP in reporting-only mode first, administrators can identify all legitimate scripts and domains, then build a strict enforcement policy that blocks any unauthorized activity.",

This tool should be configured to continuously monitor all critical application files, especially JavaScript (.js) files, for any unauthorized changes, additions, or deletions. Attackers perpetrating a skimming attack must modify existing scripts or add new ones to the checkout page. A FIM system would immediately detect this modification by comparing the file's current hash to a known-good baseline hash. This would trigger an alert for security teams to investigate, allowing them to detect and remove the malicious code potentially before any customer data is stolen, or at least limit the duration of the breach.",
