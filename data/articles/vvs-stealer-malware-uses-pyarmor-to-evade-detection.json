  "title": "New Python-Based VVS Stealer Uses PyArmor to Evade Antivirus and Steal Discord Credentials",
  "summary": "A new information-stealing malware named VVS Stealer is being sold on Telegram and used to target Discord users. Written in Python, the stealer's key feature is its use of the legitimate tool PyArmor to heavily obfuscate its code, allowing it to bypass static analysis and signature-based antivirus detection. Once on a victim's system, VVS Stealer establishes persistence and proceeds to steal a wide range of data. It specifically targets Discord, using the Windows DPAPI to decrypt authentication tokens and malicious JavaScript injection to capture password changes in real-time. The malware also exfiltrates cookies, history, and saved passwords from nearly 20 different web browsers, sending the stolen data to an attacker-controlled Discord webhook.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nA new Python-based information stealer, **VVS Stealer**, is being actively marketed on **[Telegram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(software))** and deployed against users of the popular communication platform **[Discord](https://discord.com/)**. The malware's primary innovation is its use of **[PyArmor](https://pyarmor.dashingsoft.com/)**, a legitimate commercial-grade Python code obfuscator, to encrypt its payload. This technique makes the malware extremely difficult to analyze using static methods and allows it to evade many signature-based antivirus products. **VVS Stealer** is a comprehensive credential thief, designed to extract Discord authentication tokens, browser data (cookies, passwords, history), and inject malicious JavaScript into the Discord client to capture credentials in real-time. The stolen data is then exfiltrated via **Discord webhooks**, leveraging a trusted service to bypass network security controls.\n\n## Threat Overview\n**VVS Stealer** is part of the growing Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) ecosystem, offered on **Telegram** with subscriptions starting as low as €10. This low barrier to entry allows even unsophisticated actors to deploy capable stealer malware. The primary targets are **Discord** users, often gamers or members of cryptocurrency communities, who are tricked into downloading and running the malicious executable.\n\nThe malware's use of **PyArmor** is a significant technical feature. **PyArmor** is designed to protect Python scripts from reverse engineering, but here it is abused to conceal the stealer's malicious functions from security software. This forces defenders to rely on behavioral analysis and runtime detection rather than static signatures.\n\nOnce executed, **VVS Stealer** performs several malicious actions:\n-   Establishes persistence in the Windows Startup folder.\n-   Scans for and decrypts Discord tokens using the **Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI)**.\n-   Injects malicious JavaScript into the Discord client to intercept password changes.\n-   Steals cookies, passwords, and other data from Chromium- and Firefox-based browsers.\n-   Exfiltrates all collected data to an attacker-controlled **Discord webhook**.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nThe attack chain for **VVS Stealer** is typical for an info-stealer, but with an emphasis on evasion.\n\n1.  **Initial Access ([T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/)):** The malware is typically distributed as a malicious file disguised as a game cheat, mod, or other desirable software, often sent via a Discord message.\n2.  **Defense Evasion ([T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/)):** This is the key step. The core Python script is packed and obfuscated using **PyArmor**. The final executable is a loader that decrypts and runs the malicious Python code in memory.\n3.  **Persistence ([T1547.001 - Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/)):** The malware copies itself to the `%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup` folder to ensure it runs every time the user logs in.\n4.  **Credential Access ([T1555.003 - Credentials from Web Browsers](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/003/)):** The stealer queries the local SQLite databases used by browsers like Chrome and Edge to steal cookies and saved logins.\n5.  **Credential Access ([T1528 - Steal Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528/)):** The malware specifically searches for Discord token files. It uses the user's **DPAPI** key to decrypt the tokens, giving the attacker full access to the victim's Discord account.\n6.  **Defense Evasion ([T1056.004 - Credential API Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/004/)):** By injecting JavaScript into Discord's process, it hooks network requests to capture password changes before they are sent to Discord's servers.\n7.  **Exfiltration ([T1567.002 - Exfiltration to Web Service](https.attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/002/)):** All stolen data is bundled and sent via an HTTP POST request to a **Discord webhook** URL hardcoded in the malware.\n\n## Impact Assessment\n-   **Account Takeover:** Victims lose control of their Discord accounts, which can be used to defraud friends, spread the malware further, or sell valuable accounts (e.g., those with rare badges).\n-   **Financial Loss:** Stolen browser cookies can be used to bypass MFA and access online banking, cryptocurrency exchanges, and other financial accounts.\n-   **Identity Theft:** The combination of stolen credentials and personal information from various sources can lead to comprehensive identity theft.\n-   **Further Compromise:** Stolen credentials for one service are often reused elsewhere, allowing attackers to compromise a victim's entire digital life.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n- Execution of Python interpreters (`python.exe`) from unusual locations or by unexpected parent processes.\n- Network connections to `discord.com/api/webhooks/` from processes other than the official Discord client.\n- Modifications to the files within Discord's application data folders (`%APPDATA%\\discord\\`).\n\n| Type | Value | Description | Context | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| file_path | `%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup` | The malware places a copy of itself in this folder for persistence. | File Integrity Monitoring, EDR | high |\n| url_pattern | `discord.com/api/webhooks/` | The malware exfiltrates data to Discord webhooks. Monitor for POST requests to this URL pattern from any process. | Network Proxy Logs, Firewall Logs | high |\n| command_line_pattern | `taskkill /f /im discord.exe` | The malware kills the Discord process before injecting its malicious JavaScript. | EDR, Windows Event ID 4688 | high |\n\n## Detection & Response\n- **Behavioral Analysis:** Since static analysis is defeated by **PyArmor**, detection must focus on behavior. An EDR solution that monitors process behavior is key. It should alert on a new executable dropping a file in the Startup folder, accessing browser credential stores, and making outbound connections to a Discord webhook. This is an application of **[D3-PA: Process Analysis](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ProcessAnalysis)**.\n- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Monitor all outbound HTTP/S traffic. Even if the payload is encrypted, the destination URL for the Discord webhook is often in plaintext. Block all connections to `discord.com/api/webhooks/` from endpoints that are not explicitly authorized to use them. This aligns with **[D3-OTF: Outbound Traffic Filtering](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:OutboundTrafficFiltering)**.\n- **Memory Scanning:** Advanced EDR or antivirus tools can perform in-memory scanning to detect the malicious Python code after it has been decrypted by the PyArmor loader.\n\n## Mitigation\n- **User Education:** The primary defense is to not run executables from untrusted sources. Users should be warned about the dangers of downloading game cheats, cracks, or other suspicious files, especially those sent by strangers on Discord.\n- **Principle of Least Privilege (User Accounts):** Running as a standard user without administrative privileges can limit the malware's ability to establish persistence or inject into certain system processes.\n- **Password Manager:** Encourage the use of a password manager. While this doesn't stop cookie theft, it prevents the theft of a master list of passwords stored in the browser's built-in manager.\n- **Application Whitelisting:** In a corporate environment, use application whitelisting (**[D3-EAL: Executable Allowlisting](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ExecutableAllowlisting)**) to prevent any unauthorized executables from running, regardless of whether they are detected as malicious.",

Organizations must deploy an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution capable of deep process analysis. A properly configured EDR would detect the chain of malicious behaviors exhibited by VVS Stealer, even if the executable file itself is unknown. A detection rule could be built to trigger a high-severity alert if a single process performs the following sequence: 1) Is executed from a temporary or user download folder. 2) Creates a file in a startup location. 3) Accesses files associated with browser credential storage (e.g., `Local State`, `Login Data` files). 4) Makes an outbound HTTP POST request to a URL containing `/api/webhooks/`. This correlation of behaviors is a powerful way to identify info-stealers regardless of their obfuscation.",

If a legitimate business use case for Discord webhooks exists (e.g., for DevOps notifications), specific exceptions can be made for the authorized source servers.
