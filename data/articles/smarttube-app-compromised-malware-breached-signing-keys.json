  "summary": "A significant supply chain attack has compromised the popular ad-free YouTube client for Android TV, SmartTube. An attacker stole the developer's signing keys and distributed a malicious update containing surveillance-style malware through official channels. The malware, hidden in versions 30.43 through 30.55, collected device information and sent it to a command-and-control server. In response, Google Play Protect began automatically disabling the app on user devices. The developer has since revoked the compromised keys and released a new, clean version, which requires all users to perform a manual reinstallation to ensure their security.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nA severe supply chain attack has impacted users of **[SmartTube](https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTube)**, a popular open-source YouTube client for Android TV. Threat actors compromised the developer's signing keys, allowing them to distribute a malicious version of the application through the app's official update channels and its **[GitHub](https://github.com)** repository. The malicious payload, a surveillance-style malware, was designed to fingerprint infected devices and exfiltrate data to a remote server. **[Google](https://www.google.com)**'s Play Protect service has taken action by disabling the compromised app on user devices. The developer has issued a new, clean version signed with a new key, necessitating a full uninstall and reinstall by all users.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Overview\nThe incident came to light when users reported that **[Google Play Protect](https://www.android.com/play-protect/)** was automatically disabling their SmartTube app, flagging it as a risk. The developer, Yuriy Yuliskov, confirmed that his development machine was infected with malware, leading to the theft of his digital signing keys in late November 2025. This compromise enabled the attacker to inject malicious code into official application packages (APKs) for versions 30.43 through 30.55.\n\nThe attacker leveraged the app's built-in updater and its official GitHub repository to distribute the compromised versions. This method ensured that users received the malicious update through what they believed were trusted channels, a classic hallmark of a sophisticated supply chain attack.\n\n## Technical Analysis\nForensic analysis of the infected APKs revealed a malicious native library, named `libalphasdk.so` or `libnativesdk.so`. This component was not part of the legitimate open-source code. The malware was designed to initialize automatically upon the app's launch without any user interaction.\n\nOnce active, the malware performed device fingerprinting, collecting a range of data, including:\n- Device UUID\n- Local IP address\n- Android OS version\n- Device manufacturer and model\n- Network operator information\n\nThis data was then encrypted and exfiltrated to a remote command-and-control (C2) server. While immediate destructive actions were not observed, the malware established a persistent backdoor on infected devices, granting the attacker the capability to launch further attacks, such as stealing more sensitive data or incorporating the device into a botnet.\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK Techniques\n- **[`T1195.002 - Compromise Software Supply Chain: Compromise Software Development Environment`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/002/)**: The attacker compromised the developer's machine to steal signing keys.\n- **[`T1645 - Signed Binary Proxy Execution`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1645/)**: The malicious update was signed with legitimate, albeit stolen, keys to bypass security checks.\n- **[`T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041/)**: The malware transmitted collected device information to an attacker-controlled server.\n- **[`T1518.001 - Software Discovery: Security Software Discovery`](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518/001/)**: The malware's stealthy nature implies it was designed to evade detection by security tools like Google Play Protect.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe primary impact is the erosion of trust in a widely used open-source application. All users who updated to the compromised versions had their device information exposed, creating a significant privacy risk. The backdoor established by the malware left tens of thousands of users vulnerable to follow-on attacks. The incident also forced the developer to take drastic measures, including revoking the old signature and requiring a manual reinstallation, causing significant disruption and inconvenience for the user base.\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\nSecurity teams and technically savvy users can hunt for signs of compromise by looking for the following:\n\n| Type | Value | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| File Name | `libalphasdk.so` | Malicious native library found within the SmartTube application package. |\n| File Name | `libnativesdk.so` | An alternative name for the malicious native library. |\n| Network Traffic Pattern | Unusual outbound connections | Monitor for connections from the SmartTube app process to unknown or suspicious IP addresses, especially shortly after app launch. |\n\n## Detection & Response\n1.  **Endpoint/Device Scanning**: Use Mobile Device Management (MDM) or Android security tools to scan for the presence of `libalphasdk.so` or `libnativesdk.so` within the SmartTube app's data directory.\n2.  **Network Monitoring**: Analyze firewall or proxy logs for anomalous outbound network connections from Android TV devices. Isolate devices making suspicious connections for further investigation.\n3.  **User Reporting**: Educate users to be cautious of security warnings from Google Play Protect and to report them immediately.\n\nDefensive techniques from the **[D3FEND](https://d3fend.mitre.org/)** framework that apply include:\n- **[`D3-FA - File Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:FileAnalysis)**: Analyzing the APK to identify malicious embedded libraries.\n- **[`D3-NTA - Network Traffic Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkTrafficAnalysis)**: Detecting the malware's C2 communication by monitoring for unusual network patterns.\n\n## Mitigation\n**For Users:**\n1.  **Immediate Uninstall**: Completely uninstall the compromised version of SmartTube from your Android TV device.\n2.  **Fresh Installation**: Download and install the new, clean version (30.56 or later) ONLY from the developer's official, verified sources. Be aware that the application ID has changed.\n3.  **Monitor Accounts**: Be vigilant for any unusual activity on accounts associated with the device.\n\n**For Developers (Strategic):**\n- **[`D3-ACH - Application Configuration Hardening`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ApplicationConfigurationHardening)**: Secure the development and build environment. Use dedicated, isolated machines for signing releases.\n- **Code Signing Security**: Store private signing keys in a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to prevent theft, even if the development machine is compromised.\n- **[`D3-SBV - Service Binary Verification`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ServiceBinaryVerification)**: Implement processes to verify the integrity of release binaries before publishing, comparing them against builds from a clean, trusted environment.",
