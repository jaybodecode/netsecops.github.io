  "title": "Moxa Warns of Critical RCE Vulnerability (CVE-2023-38408) in Industrial Ethernet Switches",
  "summary": "Industrial networking vendor Moxa has issued a security advisory for a critical vulnerability, CVE-2023-38408, affecting its EDS-G4000 and RKS-G4000 series industrial Ethernet switches. The flaw resides in the OpenSSH service integrated into the device firmware and could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. These switches are commonly used in critical infrastructure and industrial control systems (ICS), making the vulnerability particularly high-risk. The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security has echoed the warning, and both organizations are urging administrators to apply the provided firmware updates immediately to mitigate the threat.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nIndustrial networking company **[Moxa](https://www.moxa.com)** has alerted customers to a **critical vulnerability** in the firmware of two of its industrial Ethernet switch product lines. The flaw, tracked as `CVE-2023-38408`, exists in the **[OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/)** component and could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE). The affected products, the EDS-G4000 and RKS-G4000 series switches, are specifically designed for harsh environments and are widely deployed in industrial control systems (ICS) and critical infrastructure sectors like energy, transportation, and manufacturing. A successful exploit could lead to a complete compromise of the network device, enabling an attacker to disrupt industrial processes or pivot deeper into the operational technology (OT) network. The **Canadian Centre for Cyber Security** has also issued an alert, amplifying the urgency for administrators to apply the available patches.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n- **CVE ID:** `CVE-2023-38408`\n- **Severity:** Critical (CVSS score is not specified in the articles but the flaw type in OpenSSH often scores 9.8)\n- **Component:** OpenSSH service in device firmware.\n- **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE).\n- **Description:** The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code by targeting the SSH service on the device. `CVE-2023-38408` specifically refers to a flaw where a malicious SSH client or server could trick the other into loading code from `pkcs11.so` and executing it, if certain libraries are forwarded. This could lead to a full takeover of the switch.\n\n---\n\n## Affected Systems\nThe vulnerability affects the following Moxa industrial switch series:\n- **Moxa EDS-G4000 Series:** Firmware versions v4.1 and prior.\n- **Moxa RKS-G4000 Series:** Firmware versions v5.0 and prior.\n\nThese devices are ruggedized switches intended for deployment in factory floors, power substations, railway systems, and other critical infrastructure environments.\n\n---\n\n## Impact Assessment\n- **ICS/OT Network Compromise:** A compromised network switch is a critical failure in any network, but in an ICS environment, the impact is magnified. An attacker can manipulate, block, or redirect network traffic, disrupting physical industrial processes.\n- **Loss of View and Loss of Control:** Attackers could isolate the switch from the management network, preventing operators from monitoring or controlling the industrial process (Loss of View). They could also send malicious commands to PLCs or other controllers connected to the switch (Loss of Control).\n- **Pivot Point into OT Environment:** The compromised switch provides an ideal foothold for an attacker to launch further attacks against other sensitive devices on the OT network segment.\n- **System Sabotage:** An attacker with RCE on the switch could wipe its configuration, rendering it inoperable and causing a network outage that halts industrial operations.\n\n---\n\n## Cyber Observables for Detection\n| Type | Value | Description | Context | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| network_traffic_pattern | Anomalous SSH connections | SSH connections to the switch's management interface from untrusted or unexpected IP addresses. | Firewall and network access logs. | medium |\n| log_source | Moxa switch system logs | Monitor for unexpected reboots, service crashes (especially the SSH daemon), or error messages related to the `pkcs11` library. | SIEM analysis of device syslog. | high |\n| process_name | Unexpected processes on the switch | If process monitoring is possible, look for any child processes spawned by the SSH daemon that are not part of its normal operation. | Advanced device monitoring. | low |\n\n---\n\n## Detection Methods\n- **Asset and Firmware Inventory:** The first step is to identify all Moxa EDS-G4000 and RKS-G4000 series switches in the environment and check their firmware versions against the advisory. This is critical for OT asset management.\n- **Network Access Monitoring:** Monitor all SSH (`port 22`) access attempts to the switches. Alert on any connections originating from outside the designated management network or from unauthorized administrator workstations. This is a form of **[D3FEND Inbound Traffic Filtering (D3-ITF)](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:InboundTrafficFiltering)**.\n- **Configuration Change Detection:** Use network configuration management tools to detect any unauthorized changes to the switch's running configuration, which could be a sign of compromise.\n\n---\n\n## Remediation Steps\n1.  **Apply Firmware Updates:** Moxa has released patched firmware versions for the affected products. Administrators must download and apply these updates as the primary means of remediation. This is a direct application of **[D3FEND Software Update (D3-SU)](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SoftwareUpdate)**.\n2.  **Network Segmentation and Hardening:** As a critical best practice in all ICS environments, ensure that the management interfaces of switches and other control system devices are on a separate, isolated network. Access to this management network should be strictly controlled via firewalls and jump boxes.\n3.  **Disable SSH if Unused:** If SSH is not required for the management of the switch, it should be disabled to completely remove this attack vector.\n4.  **Use Access Control Lists (ACLs):** If SSH must be enabled, configure ACLs on the switch itself or on an upstream firewall to restrict SSH access to only a small list of authorized IP addresses.",

Therefore, this must be scheduled during a planned maintenance window.

Use an OT asset inventory system to identify all affected EDS-G4000 and RKS-G4000 switches and track the patching progress to completion. Given the critical nature of the vulnerability and the devices, this should be a top priority for the control systems engineering team.",

The management interfaces of all Moxa switches should be placed on a dedicated, out-of-band management network that is physically or logically separated from the process control network and the corporate IT network. Access to this management network should be controlled by a firewall and restricted to a handful of authorized jump boxes or administrator workstations. This prevents an attacker on the IT network or another part of the OT network from being able to reach the vulnerable SSH service on the switch, effectively containing the risk.",
