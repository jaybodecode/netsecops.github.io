  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\nAt its annual re:Invent 2025 conference, **[Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)** bestowed two of its highest partner honors upon cybersecurity firm **[CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/)**. The company was named the **AWS 2025 Global Security Partner of the Year** and the **AWS 2025 Global Marketplace Partner of the Year**. These awards highlight CrowdStrike's dominant position in cloud security and its immense success in leveraging the AWS Marketplace as a go-to-market channel. The recognition was bolstered by CrowdStrike's milestone achievement of surpassing $1 billion in AWS Marketplace sales in 2025.\n\n---\n\n## Partnership Success\nThe awards recognize AWS partners who demonstrate specialization, innovation, and customer success. CrowdStrike's dual win is a testament to its deep integration with the AWS ecosystem and the high demand for its Falcon platform to secure cloud workloads.\n\nA key factor in this success is CrowdStrike's achievement of becoming the first cloud-native Independent Software Vendor (ISV) to drive over **$1 billion in AWS Marketplace sales** in a single year. This indicates a massive customer preference for procuring security solutions directly through the cloud marketplace, simplifying billing and deployment.\n\nCrowdStrike also received several regional awards, including:\n- Technology Partner of the Year for Canada\n- Technology Partner of the Year for Iberia\n- Technology Partner of the Year for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)\n- Technology Partner of the Year for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)\n\n## Strategic Collaboration\nDaniel Bernard, CrowdStrike's chief business officer, emphasized the deep collaboration between the two companies, noting that **Amazon** itself uses CrowdStrike to secure its own vast infrastructure. This serves as a powerful endorsement of the Falcon platform's capabilities.\n\nEarlier in 2025, the partnership was expanded to reach small and medium-sized businesses, with the announcement that `CrowdStrike Falcon Go` would be included with every Amazon Business Prime subscription. This move aims to embed CrowdStrike's AI-powered security into businesses of all sizes that operate within the Amazon ecosystem.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nCrowdStrike's recognition and sales milestone reflect a major shift in how enterprise security software is purchased and deployed. The success of the AWS Marketplace model streamlines procurement and allows customers to use existing AWS spending commitments to purchase third-party software. For CrowdStrike, the partnership provides direct access to a massive global customer base. For AWS, having a best-in-class security partner like CrowdStrike deeply integrated into its platform strengthens its overall security posture and value proposition for customers.",
