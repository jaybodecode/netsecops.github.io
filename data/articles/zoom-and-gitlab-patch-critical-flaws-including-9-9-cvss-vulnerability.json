  "title": "Zoom and GitLab Release Patches for Critical Vulnerabilities, Including Near-Perfect 9.9 CVSS RCE Flaw in Zoom Node",
  "summary": "Both Zoom and GitLab have released critical security updates to address several high-severity vulnerabilities. The most severe flaw, CVE-2026-22844, is a remote code execution vulnerability in Zoom Node Multimedia Routers (MMRs) with a near-perfect CVSS score of 9.9. This flaw could allow an unauthenticated attacker with network access to compromise the devices. GitLab's updates address multiple vulnerabilities, including two high-severity flaws (CVE-2025-13927 and CVE-2025-13928) that could allow an unauthenticated user to cause denial-of-service conditions. Users of all affected products are urged to apply the patches immediately.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\n**[Zoom](https://zoom.us)** and **[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)** have both released critical security patches to address a range of high-severity vulnerabilities in their products. The most alarming is **CVE-2026-22844**, a vulnerability in **Zoom Node Multimedia Routers (MMRs)** with a CVSS score of 9.9, which could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code. GitLab's update is also significant, fixing multiple flaws including two that could be exploited for Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, potentially disrupting critical development and CI/CD pipelines. The releases underscore the persistent threat of vulnerabilities in widely-used collaboration and development platforms, and administrators are strongly advised to apply the updates without delay.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerabilities Addressed\n\n### Zoom\n- **CVE-2026-22844:** This is a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting **Zoom Node Multimedia Routers (MMRs)**.\n    - **CVSS Score:** 9.9 (Critical)\n    - **Impact:** Allows an attacker with network access to execute arbitrary code on the device, leading to a full compromise.\n    - **Vector:** Network\n\n### GitLab\n- **CVE-2025-13927 & CVE-2025-13928:** These are high-severity vulnerabilities affecting GitLab.\n    - **Impact:** Could allow an unauthenticated attacker to create a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition.\n    - **Risk:** Disruption of software development, CI/CD pipelines, and source code management.\n\nOther vulnerabilities patched by both vendors include potential two-factor authentication bypasses and other DoS flaws.\n\n## Affected Products\n- **Zoom:** Zoom Node Multimedia Routers (MMRs). Specific affected versions should be confirmed via the official Zoom security bulletin.\n- **GitLab:** Multiple versions of GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE). Users should consult the GitLab release post for detailed version information.\n\n## Impact Assessment\n- **Zoom (CVE-2026-22844):** A 9.9 CVSS RCE vulnerability in a core network component like an MMR is a worst-case scenario. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to intercept or manipulate real-time communication traffic, gain a persistent foothold in the corporate network, and pivot to attack other internal systems. The high CVSS score indicates the flaw is likely easy to exploit and requires no user interaction.\n- **GitLab (DoS Flaws):** While not as severe as RCE, a DoS attack against a central GitLab instance can bring an organization's entire software development lifecycle to a halt. This stops developers from committing code, breaks automated build and deployment pipelines, and can result in significant financial and productivity losses.\n\n## Remediation Steps\nThere are no workarounds for these critical vulnerabilities. The only course of action is to patch.\n\n1.  **Update Immediately:** Administrators for both Zoom and GitLab must prioritize the installation of the latest security updates. This is the most critical step and aligns with **MITRE ATT&CK Mitigation** [`M1051 - Update Software`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1051/).\n2.  **Verify Patch Installation:** After applying the updates, verify that the new version is running and the systems are no longer vulnerable using scanners or manual checks.\n3.  **Restrict Access (Interim Control):** For the Zoom Node MMRs, ensure that the management interfaces are not exposed to the internet and are only accessible from a trusted management network. This can serve as a temporary compensating control but does not replace the need to patch.\n\n## Detection Methods\n- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Run authenticated and unauthenticated vulnerability scans against your Zoom Node and GitLab infrastructure to identify any instances that are missing the latest security updates.\n- **Network Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic to and from Zoom Node MMRs for any unusual patterns or connection attempts from untrusted sources that could indicate scanning or exploitation attempts related to **CVE-2026-22844**.\n- **Log Analysis:** For GitLab, monitor application and system logs for a sudden spike in errors or resource consumption that could indicate a DoS attack in progress.",
