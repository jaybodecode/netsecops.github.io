  "title": "Zoom and GitLab Release Patches for Critical Vulnerabilities, Including Near-Perfect 9.9 CVSS RCE Flaw in Zoom Node",
  "summary": "Both Zoom and GitLab have released critical security updates to address several high-severity vulnerabilities. The most severe flaw, CVE-2026-22844, is a remote code execution vulnerability in Zoom Node Multimedia Routers (MMRs) with a near-perfect CVSS score of 9.9. This flaw could allow an unauthenticated attacker with network access to compromise the devices. GitLab's updates address multiple vulnerabilities, including two high-severity flaws (CVE-2025-13927 and CVE-2025-13928) that could allow an unauthenticated user to cause denial-of-service conditions. Users of all affected products are urged to apply the patches immediately.",
  "full_report": "## Executive Summary\n**[Zoom](https://zoom.us)** and **[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)** have both released critical security patches to address a range of high-severity vulnerabilities in their products. The most alarming is **CVE-2026-22844**, a vulnerability in **Zoom Node Multimedia Routers (MMRs)** with a CVSS score of 9.9, which could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code. GitLab's update is also significant, fixing multiple flaws including two that could be exploited for Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, potentially disrupting critical development and CI/CD pipelines. The releases underscore the persistent threat of vulnerabilities in widely-used collaboration and development platforms, and administrators are strongly advised to apply the updates without delay.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerabilities Addressed\n\n### Zoom\n- **CVE-2026-22844:** This is a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting **Zoom Node Multimedia Routers (MMRs)**.\n    - **CVSS Score:** 9.9 (Critical)\n    - **Impact:** Allows an attacker with network access to execute arbitrary code on the device, leading to a full compromise.\n    - **Vector:** Network\n\n### GitLab\n- **CVE-2025-13927 & CVE-2025-13928:** These are high-severity vulnerabilities affecting GitLab.\n    - **Impact:** Could allow an unauthenticated attacker to create a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition.\n    - **Risk:** Disruption of software development, CI/CD pipelines, and source code management.\n\nOther vulnerabilities patched by both vendors include potential two-factor authentication bypasses and other DoS flaws.\n\n## Affected Products\n- **Zoom:** Zoom Node Multimedia Routers (MMRs). Specific affected versions should be confirmed via the official Zoom security bulletin.\n- **GitLab:** Multiple versions of GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE). Users should consult the GitLab release post for detailed version information.\n\n## Impact Assessment\n- **Zoom (CVE-2026-22844):** A 9.9 CVSS RCE vulnerability in a core network component like an MMR is a worst-case scenario. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to intercept or manipulate real-time communication traffic, gain a persistent foothold in the corporate network, and pivot to attack other internal systems. The high CVSS score indicates the flaw is likely easy to exploit and requires no user interaction.\n- **GitLab (DoS Flaws):** While not as severe as RCE, a DoS attack against a central GitLab instance can bring an organization's entire software development lifecycle to a halt. This stops developers from committing code, breaks automated build and deployment pipelines, and can result in significant financial and productivity losses.\n\n## Remediation Steps\nThere are no workarounds for these critical vulnerabilities. The only course of action is to patch.\n\n1.  **Update Immediately:** Administrators for both Zoom and GitLab must prioritize the installation of the latest security updates. This is the most critical step and aligns with **MITRE ATT&CK Mitigation** [`M1051 - Update Software`](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1051/).\n2.  **Verify Patch Installation:** After applying the updates, verify that the new version is running and the systems are no longer vulnerable using scanners or manual checks.\n3.  **Restrict Access (Interim Control):** For the Zoom Node MMRs, ensure that the management interfaces are not exposed to the internet and are only accessible from a trusted management network. This can serve as a temporary compensating control but does not replace the need to patch.\n\n## Detection Methods\n- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Run authenticated and unauthenticated vulnerability scans against your Zoom Node and GitLab infrastructure to identify any instances that are missing the latest security updates.\n- **Network Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic to and from Zoom Node MMRs for any unusual patterns or connection attempts from untrusted sources that could indicate scanning or exploitation attempts related to **CVE-2026-22844**.\n- **Log Analysis:** For GitLab, monitor application and system logs for a sudden spike in errors or resource consumption that could indicate a DoS attack in progress.",

Organizations must activate their emergency patching procedures. For Zoom Node MMRs, this involves following Zoom's specific update guidance for the hardware. For GitLab, administrators should upgrade their instances to the latest patched version specified in the release announcement. A failure to patch the Zoom flaw could lead to a full network compromise, while ignoring the GitLab update could halt all development operations. These updates should be considered top priority for all security and IT operations teams.",
