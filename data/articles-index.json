      "excerpt": "Cisco has revealed that a China-affiliated advanced persistent threat (APT) group, tracked as UAT-9686, is actively exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability in its email security products. The flaw, CVE-2025-20393, is a remote code execution vulnerability with a maximum CVSS score of 10.0, affecting Cisco Secure Email Gateway and Secure Email and Web Manager appliances. The attackers have been exploiting the flaw since late November 2025 to gain root-level access and have deployed persistence mechanisms on compromised devices. Due to active exploitation by a nation-state actor, CISA has added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, mandating immediate patching for federal agencies.",

The use of generative AI in coding is producing insecure code faster than security teams can remediate it, creating a significant risk gap. API attacks have surged by 41% year-over-year, and lenient identity and access management (IAM) remains a top vulnerability. The report calls for a unified, platform-based approach to cloud security to counter AI-weaponized threats.",

Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez stated that attackers stole staff email passwords, allowing them to access an unknown number of document files. While the government is still assessing the scale, a hacker group named 'Indra' has claimed, without evidence, to have exfiltrated police files on 16.4 million citizens. In response, the ministry is rolling out two-factor authentication and resetting passwords. The attack on the high-value government target, which oversees national police and security, has raised speculation of nation-state involvement, with groups like APT28 being considered.",

Discovered by Push Security, the browser-native attack tricks users into completing a fake verification process that involves copying a URL containing a sensitive OAuth authorization code from their browser's address bar and pasting it into the attacker's phishing page. The attacker then uses this code to authenticate as the user via the legitimate and trusted Microsoft Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI). Because the Azure CLI is a first-party app, it bypasses many consent restrictions, granting the attacker full account access.

Their methods involve social engineering victims into running malicious commands (`ClickFix`), which fetch and execute PowerShell scripts from spoofed domains. A key technique is dropping a trojanized version of a SentinelOne security agent DLL to run malware under the guise of a trusted process.

      "excerpt": "A new security advisory warns that Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers represent a significant and growing supply chain risk for organizations building AI-powered applications. These servers act as highly privileged automation engines, often possessing trusted access to sensitive enterprise resources like code repositories, email systems, and internal APIs. The warning follows the analysis of a critical vulnerability at hosting service Smithery.ai, where a single path traversal flaw could have allowed an attacker to gain administrative control over 3,000 hosted MCP servers. This and other incidents demonstrate that MCP servers are high-value targets that can be exploited to compromise entire AI software supply chains.",

The attacker leveraged a flaw in a legacy yETH stableswap smart contract, using a deposit of just 16 wei (a fraction of a cent) to mint a massive 235 septillion yETH tokens. The vulnerability stemmed from the contract's failure to clear cached storage variables after liquidity was fully drained. By manipulating these phantom balances, the attacker triggered an 'infinite mint' condition, subsequently draining the pool's assets into a Balancer pool. Around $3 million was quickly laundered through the Tornado Cash mixer.",

Clapsis then used this access to infiltrate the online accounts of multiple women, stealing thousands of private images and videos.

The scan, performed using the open-source tool TruffleHog, highlights the pervasive issue of developers hardcoding secrets in public code. Alarmingly, 406 valid GitLab access tokens were found within GitLab's own repositories. The research also uncovered 'zombie secrets' that have remained valid for over a decade, posing a long-term risk. Marshall's responsible disclosure efforts led to multiple bug bounty payouts.",

The attack disrupted essential services, including phone lines, for over half a million residents. The councils, which operate under a joint IT arrangement, were forced to activate emergency protocols to maintain critical functions. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is assisting with the investigation.

      "excerpt": "On November 26, 2025, researchers disclosed a novel indirect prompt injection attack called 'HashJack' that targets AI-enabled web browsers. The technique works by embedding malicious instructions in the fragment portion of a URL (the text following a '#' symbol). Because URL fragments are processed client-side and are not sent to the server, they are invisible to most network security tools like firewalls and web gateways. However, AI assistants integrated into browsers often parse the full URL, including the fragment, to gain context. This allows an attacker to craft a seemingly benign link that, when visited, secretly instructs the user's AI assistant to perform malicious actions, creating a significant new attack surface.",

      "excerpt": "A sophisticated phishing campaign is targeting organizations across Central and Eastern Europe, using HTML smuggling to deliver credential harvesting forms. Researchers at Cyble discovered the attack, which uses malicious HTML file attachments to bypass email security filters. Once a victim enters their credentials into the fake login page, an embedded JavaScript code exfiltrates the data directly to the attackers' private Telegram channels via the Telegram Bot API. This technique makes the campaign highly evasive, as it avoids the use of traditional, blockable C2 infrastructure.",

Amidst a government shutdown and a block by Senator Rand Paul, lawmakers failed to reauthorize the act. Security and legal experts warn this could have a chilling effect on threat intelligence sharing, with one law firm predicting a potential 80% drop. The lapse creates uncertainty and could hinder national cybersecurity efforts. In response, new legislation, the PACT Act, has been introduced to retroactively restore and extend the protections, but its future is uncertain.",

      "excerpt": "A sophisticated phishing campaign is targeting finance executives through LinkedIn direct messages, using fake invitations to an executive board as a lure. The multi-stage attack, detailed by Push Security, aims to harvest Microsoft credentials and session cookies to bypass MFA. The attack chain leverages trusted services to appear legitimate, starting with a Google open redirect, leading to a fraudulent portal hosted on Google Firebase, and using a Cloudflare CAPTCHA to evade security bots. This non-email-based phishing vector is reportedly becoming significantly more common, accounting for over a third of recent attempts tracked by researchers.",

The leak, which occurred after a ransom deadline passed on October 11, 2025, is part of a broader supply chain attack that compromised a third-party Salesforce system used by one of the airline's offshore call centers. The compromised data includes names, emails, frequent flyer information, and for some, addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth. The attack vector involved social engineering, with hackers impersonating Salesforce employees to gain access. Qantas confirmed the breach, stating it is one of 39 companies affected by the campaign and that financial data and passwords were not compromised. The incident has prompted warnings of secondary phishing attacks and a class-action complaint.",

These instructions survive across sessions and devices, and can be triggered by a user's normal prompts to execute malicious code, potentially leading to account takeover or malware deployment.",

The group also employs Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) attacks to neutralize endpoint defenses and steals backup credentials to hinder recovery, primarily targeting high-value organizations in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.",

The flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform SMTP injection by embedding carriage return and line feed characters into email commands. This enables them to bypass standard email authentication defenses like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, making it possible to send highly convincing spoofed emails that appear to originate from trusted domains. A patch is available and should be applied immediately.",

The attackers maintained long-term access to F5's internal development environments, exfiltrating portions of the BIG-IP source code, information on undisclosed vulnerabilities, and some customer configuration data. While F5 states there is no evidence of software supply chain modification, the incident poses a significant future risk. In response, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued Emergency Directive 26-01, mandating all federal civilian agencies to immediately patch F5 products, inventory devices, and remove end-of-life systems from their networks.",

The compromise occurred in June 2025 when attackers gained access to the airline's Salesforce-based CRM platform. The stolen data, which includes 7.3 million unique email addresses and other personal details, was released in October. The incident highlights the growing threat of supply chain attacks targeting major software vendors like Salesforce to compromise their extensive client bases. The airline's delayed response has drawn criticism for a lack of transparency.",

The attack involved a novel prompt injection technique where malicious instructions were hidden in a pull request's markdown. When a developer used Copilot to review the PR, the AI would execute the hidden commands.

Furthermore, CISO briefings to the board are becoming more frequent, and firms are maturing their operational readiness with annual incident response tests and daily data backups.",

This is a massive jump from just 12% in 2023. Reputational damage is the most cited concern (38%), followed closely by cybersecurity risks (20%). Companies are increasingly worried about how AI expands the attack surface, introduces new vulnerabilities through third-party tools, and creates new legal and regulatory challenges. The findings highlight that while AI adoption is accelerating, corporate governance and oversight are still struggling to keep pace.",

The risk is especially high for the estimated 330,000 internet-exposed Redis instances, around 60,000 of which are believed to have no authentication enabled. Because official Redis container images disable authentication by default, these instances are vulnerable to unauthenticated RCE.
