Instead of a traditional Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model, DragonForce operates with a 'cartel-like' structure, providing affiliates with a builder to create their own branded ransomware variants. This approach facilitates the rapid proliferation of new threats, with groups like 'Devman' already seen deploying malware created with the DragonForce builder. The core malware retains Conti's technical features, including its encryption scheme and ability to spread via SMB.",

Found during an espionage investigation, the malware hides its malicious traffic within legitimate API calls to the OpenAI platform, making it extremely difficult to detect. The attackers also used .NET AppDomainManager injection by compromising Microsoft Visual Studio utilities to achieve persistence.",

The breach, which went undetected for nearly three years, involved 25 different malware types and led to a record $96.5 million (134 billion won) fine from regulators. This incident serves as a stark illustration of the severe and tangible financial consequences of long-term cybersecurity failures and inadequate threat detection.",
