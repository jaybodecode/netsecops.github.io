          "summary": "The UK is facing an 'alarming' increase in cyber threats, with a GCHQ report revealing that 'nationally significant' cyberattacks more than doubled to 204 in the past year, costing the economy billions. High-profile ransomware attacks on companies like Marks & Spencer and Jaguar Land Rover have inflicted massive financial damage. In response, the UK government is consulting on new legislation that includes a targeted ban on ransomware payments for public sector bodies and critical national infrastructure operators. The proposals aim to disrupt the ransomware business model and improve national threat intelligence through mandated incident reporting.",

The malware is also signed with a likely stolen digital certificate to evade detection, pointing to a well-resourced and stealthy adversary.",
