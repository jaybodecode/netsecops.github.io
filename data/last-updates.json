The treaty aims to establish a global legal framework for international cooperation in fighting digital crime, including provisions for rapid cross-border evidence sharing. While hailed by the UN as a major step in multilateralism, the convention has drawn sharp criticism from over 160 technology firms, including Meta and Dell, and various civil society groups. Critics warn its broad language could be used to criminalize legitimate security research and enable governments to repress dissent under the guise of fighting cybercrime.",
