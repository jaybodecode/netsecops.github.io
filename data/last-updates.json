          "summary": "A new cybersecurity report from Hornetsecurity highlights a dramatic increase in AI-powered cyberattacks throughout 2025. The analysis of over 72 billion emails revealed that the volume of malware-laden emails grew by 131% year-over-year, while phishing and scam attempts also rose significantly. The report attributes this surge to threat actors' adoption of generative AI, which enables the creation of highly convincing and sophisticated malicious content at scale. In response, 77% of CISOs now view AI-generated phishing as a major threat, and 68% of organizations have invested in AI-powered defenses, signaling a new 'arms race' in cybersecurity.",

When a user launches the compromised application, the malware activates in the background to search for and steal wallet files and other valuable information. This discovery underscores the increasing trend of threat actors developing malware for the macOS platform, challenging the perception of it being inherently more secure than Windows.",

          "summary": "A new threat report from cybersecurity firm Darktrace highlights a dramatic increase in sophisticated cyber threats across the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) region. The report, covering the 12 months to July 2025, details a surge in supply chain attacks, business email compromise, and cloud intrusions. State-sponsored groups from China (APT40, APT41) and North Korea (Lazarus/Bluenoroff) are reportedly leveraging generative AI to create more convincing phishing emails, particularly in non-English languages like Japanese. The report also notes the high cost of supply chain breaches and the use of advanced voice-phishing by groups like Scattered Spider.",

The implant provides the attackers with adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) capabilities, allowing them to intercept and hijack legitimate software updates within a compromised network. EdgeStepper is deployed as part of a larger toolset that includes 'LittleDaemon' and 'DaemonicLogistics' to deliver a Windows implant called 'SlowStepper'. This framework enables the APT group to conduct espionage and deploy additional malware by masquerading as legitimate update traffic.",

The attackers exploited the 'CitrixBleed2' vulnerability (CVE-2025-5777) to gain initial access and subsequently exfiltrated 5.7 terabytes of highly sensitive data. The stolen information includes Social Security numbers, medical details, and confidential investigative files. The attack, which occurred in August 2025, caused a three-week operational disruption for the agency's 1,200 staff members. The OAG has refused to pay the ransom and is working with the FBI on the investigation.",
