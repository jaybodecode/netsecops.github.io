          "summary": "Palo Alto Networks' 2025 'State of Cloud Security Report' reveals that the rapid adoption of AI is creating an unprecedented expansion of the cloud attack surface. The study, surveying 2,800 security leaders, found that 99% of organizations have had their AI systems attacked in the last year. The use of generative AI in coding is producing insecure code faster than security teams can remediate it, creating a significant risk gap. API attacks have surged by 41% year-over-year, and lenient identity and access management (IAM) remains a top vulnerability. The report calls for a unified, platform-based approach to cloud security to counter AI-weaponized threats.",

This technique is designed to bypass email security controls. When the user opens the ISO, it mounts a virtual drive with a disguised executable. Running this file triggers a memory-resident infection chain that deploys Phantom Stealer, which then harvests browser credentials, crypto wallets, and other sensitive data for exfiltration.",

Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez stated that attackers stole staff email passwords, allowing them to access an unknown number of document files. While the government is still assessing the scale, a hacker group named 'Indra' has claimed, without evidence, to have exfiltrated police files on 16.4 million citizens. In response, the ministry is rolling out two-factor authentication and resetting passwords. The attack on the high-value government target, which oversees national police and security, has raised speculation of nation-state involvement, with groups like APT28 being considered.",

          "summary": "A novel and sophisticated phishing attack dubbed 'ConsentFix' allows attackers to hijack Microsoft accounts without stealing passwords or bypassing multi-factor authentication (MFA). Discovered by Push Security, the browser-native attack tricks users into completing a fake verification process that involves copying a URL containing a sensitive OAuth authorization code from their browser's address bar and pasting it into the attacker's phishing page. The attacker then uses this code to authenticate as the user via the legitimate and trusted Microsoft Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI). Because the Azure CLI is a first-party app, it bypasses many consent restrictions, granting the attacker full account access. The technique is active and circumvents even phishing-resistant authentication like passkeys.",

The group targets government, logistics, and telecommunications sectors. Their operations are powered by the 'DDoSia Project,' a crowdsourced botnet of volunteers who are paid in cryptocurrency for participating in attacks. The group, believed to have links to Russian state entities, uses a resilient two-tiered command-and-control infrastructure, making it difficult to disrupt. Despite law enforcement efforts, NoName057(16) remains a persistent threat, conducting politically motivated cyber operations to support Russian interests.",

Two of the flaws, CVE-2025-55184 and CVE-2025-67779, are high-severity Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.5) that can crash a server with a single malicious HTTP request. The third, CVE-2025-55183, is a medium-severity information disclosure flaw (CVSS 5.3) that could allow an attacker to retrieve server-side source code, potentially exposing hardcoded secrets. The React team has released new updates to address these issues, urging developers to upgrade their packages immediately amidst heightened scrutiny of the RSC architecture.",
