          "summary": "A new Android banking trojan named Herodotus has emerged, offered as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) by a threat actor known as 'K1R0'. The malware is notable for its novel evasion technique: it mimics human typing behavior by introducing random delays during remote control sessions. This method is specifically designed to defeat behavioral biometric security systems that analyze user interaction patterns to detect fraud. Active campaigns have been observed targeting banking and crypto app users in Italy and Brazil.",
