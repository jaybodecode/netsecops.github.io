          "summary": "In a case of profound operational failure, security researchers have discovered a fatal coding error in the Nitrogen ransomware group's malware that targets VMware ESXi systems. The flaw, found in the encryption routine, causes the malware to use the wrong public key during the encryption process. As a result, the decryptor provided by the gang after a ransom is paid is mathematically incapable of reversing the encryption. This means that any victim who pays the ransom for their encrypted ESXi virtual machines has zero chance of recovering their data, reinforcing law enforcement advice to not pay ransoms.",

          "summary": "A widespread social engineering campaign is using convincing voicemail-themed lures to trick victims into installing legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) software. The attack begins with an email, often from a bank-themed subdomain, leading to a webpage that prompts the user to 'listen to your message.' Instead of playing a message, the page guides the user through a series of installation steps for a legitimate tool called 'Remotely RMM.' Once installed, the software enrolls the device into an attacker-controlled environment, providing them with persistent remote access for data theft and further malware deployment.",

This new variant utilizes a 'bring-your-own-vulnerable-driver' (BYOVD) technique, bundling a legitimate but vulnerable NsecSoft NSecKrnl driver to elevate privileges and terminate endpoint security processes. This self-contained approach streamlines the attack chain, making it more efficient and harder to detect compared to previous methods where evasion tools were deployed separately.

The group, believed to be affiliated with the broader APT41 ecosystem, is exploiting a known WinRAR vulnerability (CVE-2025-8088) for initial access. Amaranth-Dragon demonstrates a high degree of stealth, using custom tools like 'Amaranth Loader' and a new 'TGAmaranth RAT' that leverages Telegram for command-and-control. The campaigns are tightly scoped, targeting countries like Cambodia, Thailand, and the Philippines, and appear to be motivated by geopolitical intelligence gathering.",

The attack resulted in the exfiltration of approximately 115,000 sensitive records containing personal and financial details of the university's donors. Security analysts believe the breach was executed via a sophisticated voice-phishing (vishing) campaign, where attackers impersonated IT support to trick an employee into providing credentials and MFA tokens on a malicious single sign-on (SSO) portal.

In 2025, the agency updated 59 entries to indicate that the flaws were being used in ransomware attacks, but it did not issue any notifications for these changes. Security experts argue that this lack of communication is a significant missed opportunity for defenders, who use the ransomware designation as a key factor in prioritizing patching.",
