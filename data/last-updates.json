          "summary": "Security researchers at Varonis have discovered a novel attack technique called 'Reprompt' that allows attackers to silently steal sensitive data from a user's Microsoft Copilot Personal session. The attack, which has since been patched by Microsoft, required only a single click on a malicious link. By chaining together several techniques, including prompt injection via a URL parameter and bypassing security filters with a 'double request' trick, an attacker could take control of the AI assistant's session. This allowed them to issue hidden commands to summarize and exfiltrate data, such as conversation history and personal files, without the user's knowledge. The vulnerability did not affect the enterprise version of Copilot.",

According to its Annual Threat Landscape Report 2025, exploits against industrial technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) systems almost doubled last year. The report, published on January 15, 2026, documented nearly 6,000 ransomware attacks and identified numerous vulnerabilities in internet-exposed assets across critical infrastructure. Cyble predicts that in 2026, attackers will increasingly target exposed Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and SCADA systems. This trend poses a significant risk to major global events, such as the 2026 Winter Olympics, where interconnected vendor systems create a rich target environment for disruption and extortion.",

The group gains initial access by exploiting public-facing vulnerabilities, including a zero-day in SiteCore products (CVE-2025-53690), and using compromised credentials. Once inside, UAT-8837 employs a variety of open-source tools, such as the Earthworm utility for creating reverse tunnels, to conduct reconnaissance, exfiltrate data, and maintain persistence.

To back their claims, Everest published screenshots showing folder structures related to marketing, sales, manufacturing designs, and financial records, primarily concerning Nissan's North American operations. This incident represents a classic double-extortion attack, where the threat actors aim to pressure the victim into paying a ransom to prevent the public release of stolen data.

Threat actors have moved beyond simple typosquatting to industrialized campaigns focused on compromising the accounts of legitimate package maintainers. These new attacks use phishing to steal developer credentials or access tokens, which are then used to publish malicious updates to widely-used, trusted packages. This makes the attacks far stealthier and more impactful. Campaigns are also becoming 'CI-aware,' designed to activate only within automated build environments to steal production secrets, marking a significant escalation in the threat to modern development pipelines.",
