The vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-48633 (Information Disclosure) and CVE-2025-48572 (Elevation of Privilege), affect the core Android Framework on versions 13, 14, 15, and 16. Google's December 2025 security bulletin confirmed the flaws may be subject to 'limited, targeted exploitation,' a pattern often associated with sophisticated spyware campaigns. Federal agencies are now mandated to patch these vulnerabilities, and all Android users are urged to apply the latest security updates as soon as possible to protect against potential device compromise.",

According to the December 4, 2025 advisory, People's Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored actors are using this malware to target government and IT sector organizations. BRICKSTORM is designed for stealth and long-term persistence in both VMware vSphere and Windows environments. It employs multi-layered encrypted communications, including DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), to hide its C2 traffic. The advisory details an attack chain where actors used a web shell for initial access, moved laterally via RDP, and ultimately deployed BRICKSTORM on a VMware vCenter server to compromise domain controllers. Agencies are urged to hunt for this threat immediately.",

With a maximum CVSS score of 10.0, the flaw allows attackers to compromise servers with a single crafted HTTP request, requiring no user interaction. The vulnerability stems from an unsafe deserialization process in the 'Flight' protocol. Following the public disclosure on December 3, 2025, multiple weaponized proofs-of-concept became available, and active exploitation attempts by threat actors, including China-nexus groups, were observed.
