          "summary": "A significant operational security (OPSEC) failure by the INC ransomware group has allowed cybersecurity firm Cyber Centaurs to recover stolen data for twelve U.S. organizations. The discovery was made after analyzing an attack involving the RainINC ransomware variant. Researchers found artifacts from the open-source backup tool, Restic, including hardcoded S3 access keys and passwords. By pivoting to this attacker-controlled infrastructure, Cyber Centaurs found that the gang had been reusing the same cloud storage repositories across multiple attacks, leaving the encrypted data of a dozen unrelated victims accessible. This rare win for defenders highlights how even sophisticated groups can make critical mistakes.",

The announcement came after a threat actor, 'daghetiaw,' attempted to sell a large customer database on a hacking forum.

While denying the breach, PcComponentes confirmed that customer data such as names, addresses, and phone numbers were exposed for accounts with reused passwords. In response, the company has mandated two-factor authentication (2FA) for all users and invalidated all active sessions.",

Evolving from a prototype called 'Sphinx,' Anubis offers its affiliates a dual-execution model. In addition to standard encryption, the malware can be run with a `/WIPEMODE` parameter that irreversibly overwrites and destroys victim files, rendering them unrecoverable. This tactic fundamentally changes the extortion negotiation, as paying a ransom cannot restore the data. It indicates a strategy where attackers rely solely on the threat of leaking exfiltrated data for payment, using permanent data destruction as additional leverage. The group is targeting organizations opportunistically across the globe.",

The attackers use Rclone for data exfiltration to Wasabi cloud storage and deploy a version of Mimikatz named `kaz.exe`, both TTPs linked to the Inc group. More significantly, Osiris uses a custom-developed and signed malicious driver, 'Abyssworker' (aka Poortry), in a Bring-Your-Own-Vulnerable-Driver (BYOVD) attack to terminate security software. This driver and its loader, 'Stonestop,' have been previously associated with the Medusa ransomware gang. The use of these advanced, borrowed TTPs suggests Osiris is operated by experienced actors, possibly former affiliates of other groups.",

The attack abuses a feature in Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (VS Code), where trusting a repository can automatically execute a hidden `tasks.json` file.

The malware is inspired by Cobalt Strike and is designed for long-term stealth, surveillance, and data collection, featuring 37 default plug-ins. This development suggests that AI can now be used not just to assist, but to lead the creation of advanced cyber weapons.",

          "summary": "The digital supply chain has become a primary focus of cyber risk, as highlighted by multiple events on January 22, 2026. A new report from security firm Black Kite warns that the retail and wholesale sectors are highly exposed to attacks that exploit interconnected IT systems and shared vendors. Concurrently, SaaS security leader Obsidian Security launched the industry's first end-to-end SaaS supply chain security solution to combat the growing threat of SaaS-to-SaaS attacks, where a compromise in one application (like Salesloft) can cascade to affect hundreds of integrated partner applications (like Drift). These developments underscore the urgent need for organizations to gain visibility and control over their sprawling, interconnected digital ecosystems.",

A report from KnowBe4 Threat Labs details how attackers first compromise user credentials and then abuse trusted IT tools to create persistent, stealthy backdoors inside enterprise networks. This 'living-off-the-land' (LotL) technique allows attackers to blend in with normal administrative activity, making their presence extremely difficult to detect and highlighting the need for security teams to shift focus from signature-based detection to behavioral analysis and identity security.",

The flaw, which has a CVSS score of 6.5, allows for arbitrary JavaScript execution. The vulnerability exists because the library dynamically generates parser code from user-supplied input without proper sanitization, creating a code injection sink. This poses a significant software supply chain risk, as any application using the library to parse untrusted data could be compromised. Developers are urged to update to the patched version 2.3.0 immediately.",
