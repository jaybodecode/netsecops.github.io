          "summary": "A widespread phishing campaign is actively targeting Australians by impersonating Australia Post. Cybersecurity firm MailGuard intercepted the scam on February 9, 2026, which uses emails with the subject line \"Parcel Awaiting Instructions.\" The emails claim a delivery has failed due to an incomplete address and trick recipients into clicking a link to pay a small, fraudulent shipping fee of 1.99 AUD. The link leads to a sophisticated, multi-stage credential harvesting site designed to look like an official Australia Post portal. The site first captures the victim's full credit card details and phone number, and then, in a final crucial step, prompts for the one-time passcode (OTP) sent to their mobile. This allows the attackers to authorize fraudulent transactions immediately. The sender's email address is a clear giveaway, and users are advised to be vigilant.",

The group listed the hospital on its darknet leak site on February 4, 2026, threatening to publish the data if a ransom was not paid. However, Epworth HealthCare conducted a thorough investigation with external cybersecurity experts and found \"no verified evidence of any impact to our systems or data.\" Cybersecurity researchers have corroborated this, assessing that 0APT is likely a \"fake\" ransomware operation. The group's modus operandi involves posting a high volume of victims without providing credible proof of a breach, instead using empty files or random data streams. This tactic relies on psychological pressure and the threat of reputational damage to extort payment, representing a shift from technical intrusion to pure intimidation.",

The campaign targets organizations primarily in Uzbekistan and Russia, with a focus on manufacturing, finance, and IT sectors, though government and other entities have also been targeted. The attackers use phishing emails with password-protected ZIP archives containing a malicious LNK file. When executed, this file downloads and installs the legitimate remote administration tool, NetSupport RAT, which gives the attackers full control over the victim's system. The motives appear to be mixed, pointing towards both financially motivated cybercrime and state-aligned cyber espionage. This campaign marks a shift in tooling for the group, which previously used the STRRAT malware.",

Security researchers have discovered hundreds of malicious 'skills'—add-ons that extend the AI's functionality—that have been published by threat actors.

The primary payloads include the Atomic Stealer infostealer for macOS and other backdoors and keyloggers for Windows. The attack leverages the trusted, open-source nature of the marketplace, which lacked a formal review process for submissions. In response to the discovery by KOI Security and SlowMist, the OpenClaw team has partnered with VirusTotal to automatically scan all skills uploaded to ClawHub to prevent further abuse.",

CISA highlighted that these devices, including firewalls, VPNs, and routers, are being actively and consistently exploited by advanced persistent threat actors as initial access vectors into federal networks. The directive is a proactive measure to shrink the government's attack surface rather than a response to a single incident, reflecting a strategic shift to harden network infrastructure against widespread exploitation campaigns.",

The campaign, which ran from June to December 2025, involved hijacking the application's update traffic to selectively redirect high-value targets to malicious servers. Instead of a widespread attack, the threat actors focused on specific organizations in government, finance, and IT across Southeast Asia and other regions. Compromised users were served a malicious installer that deployed a previously unknown backdoor called 'Chrysalis' and, in some cases, a Cobalt Strike Beacon. The breach did not affect the Notepad++ source code but compromised the distribution server, highlighting the significant risk of supply chain attacks even in trusted open-source software.",

Once inside, the group stole a limited amount of technical data and used advanced techniques to evade detection. While the attackers have not yet penetrated the core networks, officials noted their capability to deploy tools that could disrupt internet and telecommunications services.
