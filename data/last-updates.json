          "summary": "A new Windows-based ransomware strain named 'Milkyway' has been identified by researchers at CYFIRMA. Currently in a developing state, the malware encrypts files and appends a '.milkyway' extension. It employs aggressive extortion tactics via a full-screen ransom note, threatening not only to leak or sell stolen data but also to report victims to tax authorities and law enforcement if the ransom is not paid. The operators also threaten to contact the victim's clients and partners. Experts warn that Milkyway could evolve into a more sophisticated threat, potentially adopting a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model, which would significantly broaden its impact.",

Devices that are end-of-life (EOL) or end-of-support (EOS) no longer receive security updates and represent a significant risk.

The primary driver was a 105% increase in Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, which were largely motivated by geopolitically-driven hacktivism rather than direct financial gain. Hacktivist campaigns aimed to disrupt banking portals and payment systems in countries involved in geopolitical conflicts, including Israel, the U.S., and Ukraine. The report also highlights a 73% jump in data breaches and the persistent threat of multi-extortion ransomware, indicating a complex and evolving threat landscape for financial institutions.",

The malware is notable for its extensive use of 'living-off-the-land' (LotL) techniques to evade detection. The infection chain uses a batch file to establish persistence via a Run registry key, then uses PowerShell to inject shellcode directly into the memory of legitimate processes like 'explorer.exe'. This fileless, in-memory execution makes it difficult for traditional antivirus to detect. The final .NET-based payload can harvest credentials, perform surveillance via webcam and microphone, and exfiltrate data using common services like Discord and Telegram.",

The flaw, patched in March 2025, allows an attacker with local administrative privileges on a virtual machine to escape the sandbox and gain code execution on the underlying hypervisor. Research suggests the flaw is likely chained with two others (CVE-2025-22224 and CVE-2025-22226) and that an exploit toolkit may have existed a full year before the patch was released. CISA's confirmation underscores the urgent need for organizations to ensure their VMware environments are fully patched against these critical vulnerabilities.",

TLS 1.2 is now the minimum required version for all new and existing blob storage accounts across all Azure clouds. This mandatory security enhancement aims to protect data in transit from known cryptographic vulnerabilities present in the older protocols. Customers with applications or clients still relying on TLS 1.0 or 1.1 must update them to ensure continued connectivity and avoid service disruptions.",

This new variant utilizes a 'bring-your-own-vulnerable-driver' (BYOVD) technique, bundling a legitimate but vulnerable NsecSoft NSecKrnl driver to elevate privileges and terminate endpoint security processes. This self-contained approach streamlines the attack chain, making it more efficient and harder to detect compared to previous methods where evasion tools were deployed separately.

Amaranth-Dragon demonstrates a high degree of stealth, using custom tools like 'Amaranth Loader' and a new 'TGAmaranth RAT' that leverages Telegram for command-and-control.

The attack resulted in the exfiltration of approximately 115,000 sensitive records containing personal and financial details of the university's donors. Security analysts believe the breach was executed via a sophisticated voice-phishing (vishing) campaign, where attackers impersonated IT support to trick an employee into providing credentials and MFA tokens on a malicious single sign-on (SSO) portal.
